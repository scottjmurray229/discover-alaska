Nome sits on the edge of the Bering Sea like a sentence that was never quite finished. The town of roughly 3,800 people clings to a narrow gravel spit on the southern coast of the Seward Peninsula, two miles of weathered storefronts and colorful houses facing an ocean that freezes solid each winter and thaws into a pewter expanse each spring. There is no road to Nome from anywhere else. You fly in, or you don't come at all. And yet for more than a century, people have been arriving here chasing something: gold, glory, adventure, or simply the feeling of standing at the edge of the known world.

The town was born in a frenzy. In 1898, three prospectors known as the "Three Lucky Swedes" discovered gold on Anvil Creek, and within two years Nome had swelled to a tent city of twenty thousand fortune seekers. When someone realized that the beach sand itself was laced with gold dust, the shoreline became the most crowded mining claim in history, with miners standing shoulder to shoulder shoveling sand into sluice boxes. That gold rush spirit never entirely left. To this day, recreational miners work the beach with portable dredges, and offshore suction dredge boats bob in the harbor each summer, their operators chasing the same dream that built this town.

But Nome's modern fame comes from a different kind of trail. Each March, the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race concludes on Front Street when exhausted mushers drive their dog teams under the iconic burled arch finish line. The town erupts in celebration that can last for days, with each finisher cheered in regardless of whether they arrive at noon or three in the morning. The Iditarod transforms Nome from a quiet Arctic outpost into a raucous festival of northern culture.

Beyond the gold and the dogs, Nome has quietly become one of Alaska's premier birding destinations. The Seward Peninsula's position near the Bering Strait makes it a crossroads for Asian and North American bird species, and serious birders travel from around the world each spring to spot rarities like the bristle-thighed curlew, bluethroat, and white wagtail along Nome's three gravel roads.

## What Makes Nome Special

Nome is one of the few places in Arctic Alaska with a road system, and that changes everything for visitors. Three gravel roads radiate outward from town: the Teller Road (seventy-two miles northwest), the Council Road (seventy-two miles east), and the Kougarok Road (eighty-five miles north). None of them connect to the highway system. They simply run through vast tundra landscapes before ending at remote villages or simply petering out. But they give you the ability to explore the Arctic by car, stopping to watch muskoxen grazing on hillsides, scanning tundra ponds for nesting shorebirds, or pulling over to pick blueberries from bushes so thick they stain your boots.

The cultural fabric of Nome is equally compelling. The town is a hub for the surrounding Inupiat and Yup'ik communities, and that indigenous presence shapes everything from the art in local galleries to the subsistence foods served alongside burgers and pizza in local restaurants. Muktuk (whale blubber), dried salmon, and seal oil are not novelties here; they are staples. The Carrie M. McLain Memorial Museum downtown does an outstanding job of weaving together the gold rush narrative with the far deeper history of the indigenous peoples who have lived on the Seward Peninsula for millennia.

Nome also serves as the jumping-off point for the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, one of the most remote units in the National Park System. This vast tundra landscape preserves the remnants of the land bridge that once connected Asia and North America, and it harbors ancient lava flows, hot springs, and archaeological sites dating back thousands of years.

## Things to Do

**Watch the Iditarod Finish** if you visit in mid-March. The entire town turns out to cheer mushers as they cross under the burled arch on Front Street. Events include a banquet, community celebrations, and the chance to meet mushers and their dog teams up close. Most Iditarod events are free. Hotels fill months ahead, so book early.

**Gold Panning on the Beach** is open to anyone. The beach between Nome and the harbor is public, and recreational gold panning requires no permit. You can rent a gold pan and sluice box from local shops for about $25 per day. Serious hobbyists bring their own portable dredge equipment. You will not get rich, but finding your first flake of Bering Sea gold is genuinely thrilling.

**Drive the Nome Road System** and explore some of the most accessible Arctic tundra in Alaska. Rent a vehicle from Stampede Rent-A-Car (around $150 per day for an SUV, highly recommended over a sedan) and drive all three roads. The Council Road is considered the most scenic, following the coast past abandoned gold dredges, through Safety Sound (prime birding), to the ghost town of Council. Pack a lunch, carry extra fuel, and expect no services outside of town.

**Birding the Seward Peninsula** is a world-class experience from late May through mid-July. Over 250 species have been recorded, including Asian rarities that are rarely seen anywhere else in North America. Key spots include Safety Sound, the Kougarok Road mile markers 60 to 72, and the Nome River mouth. Guided birding tours are available through local operators for $300 to $500 per day.

**Visit Pilgrim Hot Springs** via the Kougarok Road (about sixty miles from town), a natural hot spring with historical ruins of an orphanage and mission. The springs are on land managed by the local Native corporation, and access policies change, so check locally before making the drive. No fee when open.

**Bering Land Bridge National Preserve** requires a charter flight from Nome (starting around $600 per person for a day trip). Serpentine Hot Springs is the most popular destination within the preserve, offering a rustic bathhouse and extraordinary tundra hiking. The preserve is free to enter.

## Where to Stay

**Budget:** **Nome's Aurora Inn** offers basic but clean rooms starting around $130 per night, which is budget-tier for Nome. Alternatively, a handful of informal vacation rentals are available through local listings. There is no hostel in Nome, and camping within town is not practical, though wilderness camping along the road system is possible for the self-sufficient.

**Mid-Range:** **Dredge No. 7 Inn** is a comfortable hotel with modern amenities, a restaurant, and reliable WiFi. Rooms run $200 to $280 per night. It is the most popular choice for Iditarod visitors and birding groups.

**Luxury:** **Nome options top out at mid-range by most standards**, but the best available rooms at Dredge No. 7 Inn or Aurora Inn suites run $280 to $350 per night. For a more exclusive experience, consider chartering a fly-out day trip to a remote lodge or hot spring, which adds luxury through experience rather than thread count.

## Where to Eat

**Airport Pizza** is a Nome institution and arguably the best pizza in Arctic Alaska. Located right on Front Street, it serves creative pies, burgers, pasta, and surprisingly good salads. Entrees $14 to $28. The restaurant is packed during Iditarod week, so expect a wait.

**Pingo Bakery and Cafe** serves excellent coffee, fresh pastries, breakfast burritos, and sandwiches in a cozy space that doubles as an informal community gathering spot. Perfect for morning fuel before hitting the road system. Items $6 to $16.

**Bering Sea Bar & Grill** on Front Street offers hearty bar food, local fish, and cold beer in a setting that has seen its share of gold rush celebrations and Iditarod finishes. Entrees $16 to $35. The walls are covered in Iditarod memorabilia.

**Husky Restaurant** serves Korean and American comfort food, a common combination in remote Alaskan towns. The bibimbap is solid, the portions are massive, and the kimchi is made in-house. Entrees $14 to $26.

**Twin Dragons** rounds out the dining scene with Chinese-American fare that hits the spot after a long day on the tundra roads. Combination plates $16 to $24.

### Scott's Pro Tips

**Getting There:** Alaska Airlines operates daily jet service from Anchorage to Nome, with round-trip fares typically ranging from $500 to $900 depending on season and advance purchase. Book early for Iditarod week in March, when fares spike and flights sell out. Bering Air offers additional regional flights and charters.

**Best Time to Visit:** March for the Iditarod is the most festive time. Late May through early July is prime for birding, wildflowers, and the longest days. August offers berry picking and early fall colors. Winters are brutally cold and dark, but the northern lights are spectacular from November through February if you can handle temperatures dropping to negative thirty or colder.

**Getting Around:** Rent a car if you want to explore the road system, which is the main draw for summer visitors. In town, everything is walkable. Taxis are available but limited. For destinations beyond the road system, charter flights are the only option.

**Budget Tips:** Bring food from Anchorage. Groceries in Nome cost roughly double Anchorage prices due to air freight. Stock up on snacks, energy bars, and lunch supplies before flying in. Rent a gold pan instead of buying one. The free beach panning is genuinely entertaining and costs nothing beyond the pan rental.

**Safety:** The Bering Sea coast is bitterly cold even in summer. Hypothermia is a real risk if you get wet. The road system has no services, no cell coverage, and limited traffic, so carry emergency supplies, extra fuel, food, and water. Bear encounters are possible on all three roads, so carry bear spray.

**Packing:** Dress in layers for summer with a warm waterproof outer shell. Temperatures range from 35 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit June through August. Bring binoculars even if you are not a birder. Rubber boots or waterproof hiking boots are essential for tundra walking. A spotting scope is invaluable for birding. And bring a good book for weather delays, which are inevitable in Nome.
