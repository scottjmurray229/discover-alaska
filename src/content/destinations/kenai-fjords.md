The Seward Highway south from Anchorage is one of America's great scenic drives — mountains on both sides, waterfalls threading down cliffs, Dall sheep visible on the ridgelines, Turnagain Arm stretching silver toward the horizon. But the real payoff comes at the end: the small port town of Seward, gateway to Kenai Fjords National Park, where the Harding Icefield spills nearly forty glaciers down mountain valleys and into the sea.

Kenai Fjords is Alaska at its most elemental — the collision of ice, rock, and ocean. The park protects the seaward edge of the Kenai Mountains, where tidewater glaciers flow directly into the Gulf of Alaska and the rocky coastline is carved into deep fjords, sea stacks, and craggy islands. The marine environment here is staggeringly rich. Nutrient-laden currents from the Gulf of Alaska well up against the coast, feeding enormous populations of seabirds, marine mammals, and fish. A single boat tour through the park's fjords can yield humpback whales breaching, orca pods hunting, sea otters floating in rafts of a hundred or more, Steller sea lions barking from rocky haul-outs, and thousands of puffins, murres, and kittiwakes nesting on cliff faces.

The park's accessible centerpiece is Exit Glacier, the only part of Kenai Fjords reachable by road. A short drive from Seward brings you to a parking area where trails lead to the glacier's face. Interpretive signs along the approach mark where the glacier stood in various years — the retreat is sobering and vividly real. For the more ambitious, the Harding Icefield Trail climbs 3,500 feet in four miles from the Exit Glacier area to a viewpoint overlooking the icefield itself — a vast, white expanse stretching to the horizon, broken only by the dark peaks of nunataks poking through. It is one of the finest day hikes in Alaska, and standing at the top, looking out over 700 square miles of ice, recalibrates your sense of scale.

The fjords themselves — Aialik Bay, Northwestern Fjord, Harris Bay — are accessible only by boat or floatplane, and the boat tours that depart daily from Seward's small boat harbor are the most popular activity in the park. These tours range from half-day wildlife cruises to full-day expeditions that push deep into the fjords to witness tidewater glaciers calving into the sea. The water can be rough in the Gulf of Alaska, and seasickness is a genuine consideration, but the experience of cruising past a calving glacier while whales surface nearby is worth the occasional queasy moment.

## What Makes Kenai Fjords Special

Kenai Fjords is one of the most accessible places in Alaska to witness the interface between glaciers and the ocean. Exit Glacier, reachable by a 12-mile road from Seward, is one of the easiest glaciers to approach on foot in the entire state. You can stand close enough to hear the ice groan and crack, see the meltwater streaming from its face, and observe firsthand how quickly the glacier is retreating. The date markers along the trail — showing where the glacier's edge stood in 1950, 1980, 2000, 2010 — tell a visual story of climate change that is more powerful than any graph.

The Harding Icefield, which feeds all of the park's glaciers, is a remnant of the ice sheet that covered this region during the last Ice Age. At over 700 square miles, it is one of the largest icefields entirely within the United States. The icefield receives 60-80 feet of snowfall annually, compressing into the ice that feeds the glaciers below. Seeing it from the top of the Harding Icefield Trail is a genuinely humbling experience — the sheer volume of ice, stretching in every direction, makes the rest of Alaska's wilderness feel almost manageable by comparison.

The park's marine ecosystem is the other half of the story. The continental shelf drops steeply just offshore, and deep ocean currents bring nutrients to the surface that support one of the most productive marine food webs in the North Pacific. This is why the wildlife viewing on Kenai Fjords boat tours is so consistently excellent — the food chain here, from plankton to whale, is robust and concentrated.

## Things to Do

**Exit Glacier Hike** — The paved Edge of the Glacier Trail (1 mile round trip, easy) leads to a viewing area near the glacier's face. The Harding Icefield Trail (8.2 miles round trip, strenuous) climbs through wildflower meadows and snowfields to a jaw-dropping icefield overlook. Allow 6-8 hours for the full Harding Icefield hike. No entrance fee is required, but there is a $15 parking fee at Exit Glacier from Memorial Day through Labor Day.

**Full-Day Kenai Fjords Boat Tour** — The signature park experience. Major Marine Tours and Kenai Fjords Tours operate 6-8 hour cruises from Seward into Aialik Bay or Northwestern Fjord. Tours visit tidewater glaciers, seabird rookeries, and sea lion haul-outs, with frequent whale sightings. Prices run $180-250 per adult, often including a salmon or prime rib lunch. Book early for summer dates.

**Half-Day Wildlife Cruise** — Shorter 3-4 hour options focus on Resurrection Bay's wildlife without venturing as deep into the fjords. You will still see otters, sea lions, puffins, and possibly whales. Prices around $100-140 per adult. A good option if you are prone to seasickness, as the bay is calmer than the open Gulf.

**Kayaking Resurrection Bay** — Several outfitters in Seward offer guided kayak trips in Resurrection Bay, ranging from half-day paddles ($80-120) to multi-day expeditions into Aialik Bay ($500-800). Fox Island and Caines Head State Recreation Area are popular day trip destinations. Sea otters, harbor seals, and eagles are commonly spotted.

**Alaska Railroad Coastal Classic** — The train ride from Anchorage to Seward is 4 hours of stunning scenery — glaciers, mountain passes, and a stretch along Turnagain Arm. Many visitors ride the train one way and drive the other. Round-trip adult fares are about $200-240. The train runs daily mid-May through mid-September.

**Alaska SeaLife Center** — Seward's excellent marine science center and aquarium, located on the waterfront, houses Steller sea lions, harbor seals, octopuses, and seabirds in naturalistic exhibits. It is also a marine mammal research and rehabilitation facility. Admission is $25 for adults. A good rainy-day option.

## Where to Stay

**Budget ($60-110/night)** — The Exit Glacier campground inside the park has 12 walk-in tent sites for $20/night with no reservations — first come, first served. In Seward, the Moby Dick Hostel and the Seward Hostel offer dorms and private rooms. The city-run Waterfront Park campground ($25-40/night) sits right on Resurrection Bay.

**Mid-Range ($180-300/night)** — The Harbor 360 Hotel on the waterfront has excellent views and a central location. Hotel Seward and the Breeze Inn are reliable mid-range options within walking distance of the boat harbor. Van Gilder Hotel, a historic property downtown, offers character and charm.

**Luxury ($400-800/night)** — Kenai Fjords Glacier Lodge, accessible only by boat, sits on a private lagoon in the park with glacier views and all-inclusive packages. Bear Creek Cabins outside Seward offer high-end private cabins in the woods. For a unique experience, several charter boats offer overnight cruises in the fjords with private staterooms.

## Where to Eat

**The Cookery** — Seward's best restaurant, serving creative Pacific Northwest cuisine with an Alaska twist. The daily seafood specials and house-made pasta are standouts. Dinner entrees $24-42. Small space — reservations strongly recommended.

**Chinooks Waterfront Restaurant** — Right on the Seward boat harbor with views of the mountains across the bay. Known for excellent halibut, rockfish, and king crab. Dinner entrees $22-45. The upstairs bar has one of the best views in town.

**Zudy's Cafe** — A local breakfast and lunch favorite with generous portions and friendly service. Biscuits and gravy, crab omelets, and fresh-baked pastries. Meals $12-20.

**Resurrect Art Coffee House** — Housed in a former church, this cozy cafe serves excellent coffee, baked goods, and light meals in an artsy atmosphere. A perfect spot to warm up before or after a boat tour. Items $5-14.

**The Salmon Bake at Resurrect Beach** — A seasonal outdoor cookout featuring grilled wild salmon, halibut, and side dishes. Communal picnic tables, mountain views, and live music some evenings. Plates $18-28.

### Scott's Pro Tips for Kenai Fjords

**Getting There:** The drive from Anchorage to Seward on the Seward Highway is one of Alaska's most scenic routes — budget extra time for stops at turnouts along Turnagain Arm, where bore tides and beluga whales are sometimes visible. The Alaska Railroad's Coastal Classic train is an alternative that lets you enjoy the scenery without driving. If driving, watch for moose on the road, particularly near Moose Pass (aptly named).

**Best Time to Visit:** Late June through mid-August is prime season. The Harding Icefield Trail is typically snow-free by early July, and marine wildlife activity peaks in July and August. May and September are cooler and rainier but far less crowded, with lower tour prices. Exit Glacier Road is typically open May through October, weather permitting.

**Getting Around:** In Seward, most lodging, restaurants, and the boat harbor are within walking distance. You will need a car to reach Exit Glacier (12 miles from town). The free Seward trolley runs along the waterfront in summer. If you are kayaking or taking a water taxi to remote areas, outfitters handle logistics.

**Budget Tips:** Exit Glacier is free to visit (just the $15 parking fee) and the Harding Icefield Trail is one of Alaska's best free hiking experiences. Half-day wildlife cruises are significantly cheaper than full-day glacier tours and still deliver great wildlife viewing. Pack lunch for boat tours even when meals are included — you may want more food than provided. Grocery prices in Seward are high, so stock up in Anchorage.

**Safety:** Seasickness on the boat tours is a real concern — the Gulf of Alaska can be rough. Take medication before boarding (Bonine or Dramamine), not after you start feeling ill. On the Harding Icefield Trail, conditions can change rapidly above treeline — bring warm layers and rain gear even on sunny days. Snow bridges on the upper trail can be deceptive in early summer; follow cairns and use trekking poles. Stay on marked trails near Exit Glacier — ice falls and calving happen unpredictably.

**Packing:** Bring layers for boat tours — even on a sunny 60°F day in Seward, the temperature on the water near glaciers can feel like 35°F. A waterproof outer layer is essential for both hiking and boating. Binoculars dramatically improve wildlife viewing on boat tours. If you plan the Harding Icefield hike, bring trekking poles, microspikes or light crampons for snow patches, sunscreen, and 2-3 liters of water. Sunglasses are critical on the icefield — snow glare is intense.
