Juneau is the only state capital in America you cannot drive to. There is no road in and no road out. Hemmed in by the Tongass National Forest, the Juneau Icefield, and the waters of Gastineau Channel, Alaska's capital city exists in splendid isolation — accessible only by air and sea. This geographic fact shapes everything about the place, from its compact downtown hugging the mountainside to the fierce independence of its 32,500 residents who choose to live here despite the logistical challenges.

The city spills from tidewater to treeline along a narrow strip of land between steep mountains and the channel. Downtown Juneau is walkable and dense — a grid of streets lined with historic buildings from the gold mining era, state government offices, local shops, and restaurants that take Alaska seafood seriously. Behind downtown, the mountains rise sharply. The Perseverance Trail follows an old mining road into the mountains directly from the edge of town. Within fifteen minutes of the state capitol building, you can be deep in temperate rainforest surrounded by moss-draped Sitka spruce and the sound of cascading water.

Juneau's crown jewel is the Mendenhall Glacier, a river of ice flowing from the 1,500-square-mile Juneau Icefield to a lake just 13 miles from downtown. Watching the glacier calve — massive chunks of ice breaking free and crashing into the lake — is one of Alaska's most accessible and dramatic natural spectacles. The glacier has been retreating significantly in recent decades, making each visit a snapshot of a landscape in rapid transition.

The city comes alive in summer when cruise ships fill the harbor and the population swells. On peak days, four or five large ships dock simultaneously, bringing 15,000 or more visitors to a town of 32,000. This creates a complicated dynamic — the cruise industry drives the economy but strains the infrastructure and character of the community. Visit on a non-cruise day or explore beyond the immediate port area, and you will find the real Juneau: quieter, deeply connected to the land and water, and full of people who genuinely love where they live.

## What Makes Juneau Special

Juneau is where Alaska's political life, Indigenous culture, and wild landscape intersect in a remarkably compact space. The Alaska State Capitol is here, an unassuming building with no dome that you can walk through freely when the legislature is in session. The Sealaska Heritage Institute downtown preserves and celebrates Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian culture through exhibits, performances, and the stunning Walter Soboleff Building.

The natural setting is staggering. The Juneau Icefield, the fifth-largest icefield in the Western Hemisphere, feeds more than 30 glaciers that cascade down the surrounding mountains. The Tongass National Forest — the largest national forest in the United States at 17 million acres — surrounds the city. Humpback whales feed in the nutrient-rich waters of the channel and nearby Stephens Passage, creating some of the most reliable whale watching in Alaska.

The combination of accessibility and wildness is what sets Juneau apart. You can watch whales in the morning, tour the state capitol at lunch, hike through old-growth rainforest in the afternoon, and eat fresh-caught halibut for dinner — all without ever getting in a car.

## Things to Do

**Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center** — The Forest Service visitor center provides glacier views, interpretive exhibits, and access to several trails. The moderate Nugget Falls Trail (1 mile round trip) leads to a towering waterfall beside the glacier. Admission is $5. The Photo Point Trail offers the classic glacier viewing spot and is wheelchair accessible.

**Whale Watching** — Juneau is one of the best places in Alaska to see humpback whales, and sightings are virtually guaranteed from May through September. Numerous operators run 3-4 hour tours from Auke Bay. Expect to pay $150-180 per adult. Allen Marine Tours and Juneau Tours & Whale Watch are well-regarded. You will likely also see Steller sea lions, harbor seals, and bald eagles.

**Tracy Arm Fjord Day Cruise** — A full-day boat trip (8-10 hours) to Tracy Arm, a narrow fjord 50 miles south of Juneau where the Sawyer Glaciers calve icebergs into emerald water. The scenery rivals Glacier Bay. Costs run $200-280 per person and include lunch. Book well in advance for summer dates.

**Mount Roberts Tramway** — This aerial tramway departs from the cruise ship dock and rises 1,800 feet to a nature center, restaurant, and trail system above treeline. Tickets are $38 for adults. On clear days, the views stretch across Gastineau Channel, Douglas Island, and the surrounding peaks.

**Tongass Rainforest Hiking** — The trail system in and around Juneau is exceptional. Top choices include the Perseverance Trail (moderate, 6 miles round trip, starting from downtown), the West Glacier Trail (moderate, 7 miles round trip, with glacier and iceberg views), and the Treadwell Mine Historic Trail on Douglas Island (easy, with mining ruins in the forest).

**Helicopter Glacier Trek** — For a splurge, take a helicopter to the Juneau Icefield and walk on the glacier with crampons and guides. Several operators offer tours lasting 2-4 hours. Expect to pay $300-450 per person. It is an extraordinary experience on clear days.

## Where to Stay

**Budget ($90-140/night)** — Juneau International Hostel in downtown offers dorms and private rooms at excellent rates. Driftwood Hotel provides basic but clean rooms in a central location. The Forest Service cabins scattered around the Juneau area offer a rustic backcountry option at $45-65/night, bookable through Recreation.gov.

**Mid-Range ($200-320/night)** — The Westmark Baranof Hotel is a Juneau landmark in the heart of downtown with old-school Alaska charm. Silverbow Inn is a boutique option above a beloved bakery. Frontier Suites offers apartment-style rooms with kitchens a few miles from downtown.

**Luxury ($400-750/night)** — Pearson's Pond Luxury Inn & Adventure Spa is an intimate property near Mendenhall Glacier with hot tubs and garden suites. For a wilderness lodge experience, the Alaska's Capital Inn is a beautifully restored mansion above downtown with gourmet breakfasts and stunning views.

## Where to Eat

**Tracy's King Crab Shack** — A waterfront institution serving fresh Alaskan king crab legs, bisque, and crab cakes. It is not cheap (a king crab combo runs $45-65), but the crab is impeccable and the open-air harbor setting is perfect. Lines form by 11am on cruise ship days.

**Salt** — Juneau's most sophisticated restaurant, with a seasonal menu built around Southeast Alaska seafood, foraged ingredients, and local produce. Dinner entrees $28-50. Smaller but excellent wine and cocktail list. Reservations essential.

**The Hangar on the Wharf** — Built in a restored floatplane hangar over the water, this is a solid all-around choice for halibut and chips, burgers, and local craft beer. Entrees $16-32. Good for families.

**Pel'Meni** — A beloved late-night hole-in-the-wall serving Russian pelmeni (stuffed dumplings) for around $10 a bowl. Cash only, limited hours, and a Juneau rite of passage. Find it in the alley off South Franklin Street.

**V's Cellar Door** — A wine bar and small-plates restaurant in a cozy basement space. Excellent charcuterie boards, local oysters, and a curated wine selection. Perfect for a quieter evening away from the cruise crowd.

### Scott's Pro Tips for Juneau

**Getting There:** Alaska Airlines flies direct from Seattle (about 2.5 hours) and Anchorage (1.5 hours). The Alaska Marine Highway ferry connects Juneau to other Southeast communities and Bellingham, Washington — the ferry ride from Bellingham is a 3-day scenic journey through the Inside Passage. Book ferry cabins months in advance for summer.

**Best Time to Visit:** June through August offers the warmest weather (55-65°F) and longest days, but also the most cruise ship traffic. May and September are shoulder months with fewer crowds, lower prices, and still-decent weather. Whale watching is excellent May through September. Juneau receives over 60 inches of rain annually, so prepare for wet weather any time.

**Getting Around:** Downtown is walkable. For Mendenhall Glacier and the trailheads in the Mendenhall Valley, you will need a car, taxi, or bus. The Capital Transit bus system runs between downtown and the valley ($2 fare). Rental cars are available but limited — book well ahead in summer. Taxis run about $30-40 between downtown and the glacier.

**Budget Tips:** Visit the glacier on foot rather than by helicopter to save hundreds of dollars. Pack rain gear and explore the extensive free trail system. The Alaska State Museum ($15) and State Capitol (free) are worthwhile and affordable. Avoid eating at the cruise port shops — walk a few blocks uphill into the real downtown for better food at lower prices.

**Safety:** Rain is constant — waterproof everything. Trails can be slippery, and the West Glacier Trail involves some exposure near the ice. Bears (both black and brown) are present on all trails; carry bear spray and make noise. In summer, the combination of rain and cool temperatures can cause hypothermia even in July if you are unprepared. Tidal areas around the channel can have swift currents.

**Packing:** Rain gear is non-negotiable. Bring a quality waterproof jacket, waterproof hiking boots, and quick-dry layers. An umbrella is less useful in the wind — a good hood is better. Binoculars are essential for whale watching and glacier viewing. If you tend to get cold on boat tours, bring a warm hat and gloves even in summer — it is significantly colder on the water.
