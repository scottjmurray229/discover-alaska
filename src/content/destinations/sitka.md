Sitka faces the open Pacific. Unlike most Southeast Alaska towns, which tuck themselves into the sheltered channels of the Inside Passage, Sitka sits on the ocean side of Baranof Island, looking out across Sitka Sound to the volcanic cone of Mount Edgecumbe on the horizon. This exposure to the open sea gives Sitka a different character from its neighbors — wilder, more windswept, more directly connected to the vast Pacific that stretches unbroken to Japan. The ocean defines everything here: the weather, the economy, the culture, and the rhythm of daily life.

Sitka is also the place where Alaska's three great cultural streams — Tlingit, Russian, and American — converge most visibly. For thousands of years, the Tlingit people built a sophisticated civilization here, sustained by the extraordinary abundance of the sea and the rainforest. In 1799, Russian traders established a post nearby, and in 1804, after the brutal Battle of Sitka, the Russians seized control and made the town the capital of Russian America. When the United States purchased Alaska in 1867, the transfer ceremony took place here, on Castle Hill overlooking the harbor. Walk through Sitka today and you will see totem poles, onion domes, and the American flag — three civilizations layered in a single compact waterfront town.

The natural setting amplifies everything. Sitka Sound is studded with forested islands, and the Tongass National Forest presses in from every side. Bald eagles are genuinely everywhere — perched on lampposts, wheeling above the harbor, fishing in the tidal channels. Humpback whales frequent the sound in impressive numbers, and the Sitka whale watching season is remarkably long, stretching from spring through fall with occasional winter sightings. Sea otters float in rafts just offshore. Brown bears roam the surrounding islands. The rainforest trails behind town pass through cathedral groves of Sitka spruce — some trees over 700 years old — draped in moss so thick it muffles sound.

For a town of just 8,500 people, Sitka punches remarkably above its weight culturally. The Sitka Summer Music Festival draws world-class chamber musicians every June. The Sitka Fine Arts Camp hosts hundreds of young artists. The Island Institute conducts serious literary and scientific programming. These institutions exist because Sitka attracts a certain kind of person — creative, independent, willing to trade urban convenience for a life embedded in one of the most beautiful landscapes on Earth.

## What Makes Sitka Special

Sitka National Historical Park — often called "Totem Park" — is the emotional and cultural heart of the town and one of the most significant sites in Alaska. The park preserves the site of the 1804 Battle of Sitka, the last major armed resistance by the Tlingit people against Russian colonization. A one-mile trail winds through towering spruce and hemlock forest along the coast, passing a collection of totem poles from communities across Southeast Alaska. The Southeast Alaska Indian Cultural Center, housed in the park's visitor center, is where Tlingit artists practice traditional carving, weaving, and metalwork — visitors can watch and ask questions. The combination of history, art, and natural beauty makes this park unlike anything else in the national park system.

St. Michael's Cathedral, the Russian Orthodox church in the center of town, is another defining landmark. The original 1848 structure burned in 1966, but townspeople of all backgrounds rushed into the burning building to save the priceless Russian icons and artifacts. A faithful replica was rebuilt and reconsecrated, and the icons — some dating to the 17th century — are on display inside. The cathedral remains an active parish, and attending a Sunday service with its Byzantine chanting and incense is a transportive experience.

The relationship between Sitka and the ocean is intimate and practical. Commercial fishing — primarily for salmon, halibut, and black cod — remains a cornerstone of the economy. The Sitka Sound Sac Roe Herring Fishery, which takes place over just a few frantic days each spring, is one of Alaska's most intense and valuable fisheries. Walk the harbor and you will see working fishing boats, not just tour vessels. This is a town that still makes its living from the sea.

## Things to Do

**Sitka National Historical Park** — Walk the Totem Trail through old-growth rainforest, view the totem poles, and visit the Cultural Center to watch Tlingit artists at work. Admission is free. The trail is flat and accessible, taking 30-60 minutes at a leisurely pace. The park's interpretive programs are excellent.

**Whale Watching** — Sitka offers some of the best whale watching in Southeast Alaska. Multiple operators run 2-3 hour tours from Crescent Harbor. Humpback whales are the main attraction, with frequent appearances by orcas, gray whales, and Steller sea lions. Tours cost $120-170 per adult. Sitka Sound Ocean Adventures and Allen Marine offer highly rated trips.

**Alaska Raptor Center** — A rehabilitation facility for injured birds of prey, with resident bald eagles, hawks, and owls that cannot be released. The flight training center, where rehabilitated eagles practice in an enclosed space, is fascinating. Admission is $14 for adults. Located 10 minutes from downtown.

**Fortress of the Bear** — A bear rescue sanctuary housing orphaned brown bears in a converted pulp mill facility. The bears are visible from elevated platforms, and the educational programs are well-designed. Admission is $12 for adults. A 10-minute drive from downtown.

**Mount Verstovia Trail** — A challenging 5-mile round trip hike that climbs 2,500 feet from sea level through rainforest to alpine meadows with panoramic views of Sitka Sound, the surrounding islands, and Mount Edgecumbe. The shoulder (a false summit at 2,550 feet) is the turnaround point for most hikers. Allow 4-6 hours.

**Castle Hill** — The site of the 1867 Alaska Purchase transfer ceremony, where the Russian flag came down and the American flag went up. A short walk from downtown to a viewpoint overlooking Sitka Sound and the harbor. Free and accessible. The interpretation is minimal — the view and the history carry the site.

**Sea Kayaking** — Guided kayak tours explore the islands and channels around Sitka Sound, with opportunities to see otters, seals, eagles, and the rainforest shoreline up close. Half-day tours run $100-150 per person. Sitka Sound Ocean Adventures offers well-regarded paddles.

## Where to Stay

**Budget ($80-120/night)** — The Sitka International Hostel, housed in a historic building near downtown, offers dorms and private rooms at reasonable rates. Ann's Gavan Hill B&B provides budget-friendly rooms with a kitchen. For camping, the Starrigavan Campground (Forest Service, $16-24/night) sits on the coast 7 miles north of town near a salmon stream and is one of Alaska's most beautiful campgrounds.

**Mid-Range ($190-300/night)** — The Westmark Sitka is the largest hotel in town with waterfront views and a central location. The Sitka Hotel, a renovated historic property on Lincoln Street, offers character and walkability. Aspen Suites Hotel provides apartment-style rooms with kitchens. The Totem Square Inn has comfortable rooms near the harbor.

**Luxury ($400-700/night)** — The Sitka Sound Science Center Guest Suites offer a unique waterfront stay in a working marine research facility. For remote luxury, the Sitka Point Lodge on the outer coast provides all-inclusive fishing and wildlife-viewing packages accessible by floatplane. Wild Strawberry Lodge combines upscale accommodations with guided adventure packages.

## Where to Eat

**Ludvig's Bistro** — Sitka's culinary gem, a tiny Mediterranean-meets-Alaska restaurant on Lincoln Street. Chef-owner Colette Nelson sources local seafood and produces intensely flavored dishes. The paella with Sitka spot prawns is extraordinary. Dinner entrees $28-50. Reservations are absolutely essential — the restaurant seats about 30 people.

**The Larkspur Cafe** — Excellent breakfast and lunch in a bright, welcoming space. Known for creative egg dishes, house-baked bread, and locally roasted coffee. Meals $12-20. Popular on weekends.

**Highliner Coffee** — The best coffee in Sitka, with a waterfront location and harbor views. Fresh pastries, sandwiches, and soup. A good place to fuel up before a hike or plan your day over a hand-pulled espresso. Items $5-14.

**Bayview Restaurant** — A downtown spot with views over Crescent Harbor serving burgers, seafood, and hearty pub fare. Reliable and reasonably priced. Entrees $14-28.

**Beak Restaurant** — A newer addition to Sitka's dining scene, focusing on seasonal small plates and local seafood in a modern setting. The octopus and the halibut collar are standouts. Plates $12-24.

### Scott's Pro Tips for Sitka

**Getting There:** Alaska Airlines flies direct from Juneau (35 minutes) and Seattle (about 3 hours with a Juneau connection). The Alaska Marine Highway ferry connects Sitka to Juneau and other Southeast communities. The ferry ride from Juneau is about 9 hours and passes through beautiful island scenery. Note that Sitka's ferry terminal is 7 miles from downtown — a shuttle meets the ferry.

**Best Time to Visit:** June through August offers the driest weather (though "dry" is relative in a place with 86 inches of annual rain) and the warmest temperatures (55-65°F). The Sitka Summer Music Festival in June is a highlight. September brings excellent whale watching, fall colors in the muskeg, and dramatically fewer tourists. The Sitka WhaleFest in early November celebrates the peak of humpback whale activity in the Sound.

**Getting Around:** Downtown Sitka is walkable and compact — most attractions along Lincoln Street and the waterfront are within a 15-minute walk. For the Alaska Raptor Center, Fortress of the Bear, and Starrigavan Campground, you will need a car or taxi. Rental cars are available but limited; reserve well in advance. The Ride Sitka community bus runs a limited schedule.

**Budget Tips:** The best attraction in Sitka — Sitka National Historical Park — is completely free. Castle Hill, the harbor walk, and the rainforest trails are all free. Attend a free ranger program or cultural demonstration at the park visitor center. If whale watching is too expensive, walk out to the breakwater near Japonski Island, where whales are sometimes visible from shore with binoculars. Buy groceries at Sea Mart for significantly less than restaurant dining.

**Safety:** Rain is constant. Waterproof everything. Trail surfaces are often roots, rocks, and mud — ankle-supporting waterproof boots are essential. Mount Verstovia is a serious hike with exposure above treeline; do not attempt it in fog or rain without experience. Brown bears are present on Baranof Island, and encounters are possible on all trails — carry bear spray and make noise. Tidal areas around the sound can have strong currents.

**Packing:** Rain gear is the number one packing priority. Bring a high-quality waterproof jacket, waterproof pants, and waterproof boots. Rubber boots (Xtratufs are the Alaska standard) are perfect for Sitka's wet trails and tidal beach walks. Layers are essential as temperatures fluctuate. Binoculars are invaluable for whale watching from shore and for spotting eagles and wildlife on boat tours. A small packable daypack keeps your hands free on trails.
