There is a moment at Brooks Falls that changes people. You hear the roar of water first, then the low shuffle of massive paws on gravel, and suddenly you are standing on an elevated platform watching a twelve-hundred-pound brown bear launch itself into a curtain of whitewater, jaws open, and emerge with a thrashing sockeye salmon clenched in its teeth. The other visitors around you gasp. Your hands tremble holding the camera. Nothing you have seen on nature documentaries prepares you for the raw, electric proximity of it.

Katmai National Park sprawls across four million acres of the Alaska Peninsula, a landscape sculpted by volcanic fury and softened by millennia of rain, wind, and salmon. There are no roads leading here. No cell towers. No gift shops hawking stuffed moose. You arrive by floatplane, skimming low over tundra dotted with lakes that have no names, and you land on the water beside a cluster of weathered cabins that constitute Brooks Camp, the heart of the park. From this modest outpost, the wild unfolds in every direction.

Most visitors come for the bears, and rightfully so. Katmai hosts the densest concentration of brown bears on Earth, with roughly 2,200 individuals roaming its river corridors and coastal meadows. But the park holds far more than its famous ursine residents. The Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, created by the cataclysmic 1912 eruption of Novarupta, remains one of the most dramatic volcanic landscapes on the planet. Fourteen active volcanoes line the park's spine. Rivers teem with all five species of Pacific salmon. And in the backcountry, you can hike for a week without crossing another human footprint.

This is not a drive-through national park. Katmai demands commitment, planning, and a willingness to surrender control to weather, tides, and the schedules of bush pilots. That effort is the price of admission to one of the last truly wild places in North America.

## What Makes Katmai National Park Special

Katmai exists because of a catastrophe. On June 6, 1912, the Novarupta volcano erupted in the most powerful volcanic event of the twentieth century, burying forty square miles of lush river valley under seven hundred feet of ash and pumice. When a National Geographic expedition arrived four years later, they found thousands of steam vents still hissing from the ash deposits and named it the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. The valley remains an otherworldly moonscape today, a place where you can walk across a barren plain of hardened ash with glacier-carved gorges revealing colorful volcanic layers beneath your feet.

But Katmai's defining feature is the annual salmon run. Beginning in late June and peaking through July, millions of sockeye salmon surge up the Brooks River to spawn in Brooks Lake. The bears know the schedule intimately. They gather at Brooks Falls, positioning themselves at the lip of the six-foot cascade, and pluck salmon from the air with a nonchalance that borders on arrogance. The National Park Service maintains three viewing platforms at Brooks Camp, and during peak season, every spot is occupied from dawn to dusk.

What separates Katmai from other bear-viewing destinations is the sheer normalcy of the encounters. Bears walk through camp. They fish twenty feet from kayakers. Cubs play on the beach where floatplanes taxi. The park has maintained a remarkable safety record precisely because the bears here have never learned to associate humans with food, and visitors are required to follow strict protocols that keep it that way.

## Things to Do

**Brooks Falls Bear Viewing** is the signature experience. Access is free with your park entrance, but you must attend a mandatory bear safety orientation upon arrival at Brooks Camp. The three platforms (Falls, Riffles, and Lower River) offer different perspectives. Falls Platform is the iconic spot where bears catch leaping salmon. Peak viewing is July, but September brings a second surge as bears fatten before hibernation, and the fall colors are extraordinary. No additional cost beyond getting to Brooks Camp.

**Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes Tour** is operated by the park concessioner and runs daily in summer. A bus takes you on a twenty-three-mile journey from Brooks Camp to the Robert Griggs Overlook, where you can hike down into the valley floor. The full-day tour costs around $96 per person and is absolutely worth it for the geological spectacle alone.

**Backcountry Fishing** draws serious anglers from around the world. The Brooks River itself is catch-and-release only for rainbow trout, but guided fly-out fishing trips to remote rivers within the park target trophy rainbow trout, Arctic char, and all five Pacific salmon species. Guided trips run $700 to $1,500 per day depending on group size and destination. An Alaska fishing license ($25 for one day, $70 for seven days for non-residents) is required.

**Kayaking Naknek Lake** offers a quieter way to experience the park. You can rent kayaks at Brooks Camp or bring your own via floatplane. Paddling along the lakeshore, you will encounter bears foraging on the beaches and have views of Mount Katolinat and the Aleutian Range. Half-day rentals start around $75.

**Hallo Bay Bear Viewing** is an alternative to Brooks Camp, accessed by floatplane from Homer or Kodiak. Coastal brown bears dig for clams and graze on sedge grass in open meadows, allowing closer and more intimate encounters than the platform viewing at Brooks. Day trips from Homer cost $650 to $800 per person.

**Savonoski Loop** is a premier multi-day backcountry kayaking and portage route, covering roughly eighty miles over five to seven days through the park's lake system. You will see bears, moose, eagles, and no other humans. Permits are free but required.

## Where to Stay

**Budget:** Brooks Camp Campground is the only accommodation within the core park area. Sites cost $12 per night and must be reserved through recreation.gov, often many months in advance. The campground has a food cache, cooking shelter, and elevated platforms surrounded by an electric fence to keep bears out. Expect to bring all your own food and gear, flown in by floatplane.

**Mid-Range:** Brooks Lodge, operated by Katmailand, offers comfortable rooms with shared bathrooms and three meals daily at the lodge dining room. Packages typically run $875 to $1,100 per night per person, including floatplane transfer from King Salmon, lodging, and meals. The lodge fills up a year or more in advance for peak July dates.

**Luxury:** Remote wilderness lodges scattered throughout the Katmai region, such as Kulik Lodge and Grosvenor Lodge, offer all-inclusive fly-in experiences with private cabins, gourmet meals, guided fishing, and bear viewing. Expect $1,200 to $2,500 per person per night with multi-night minimums. These are among the most exclusive wilderness experiences in Alaska.

## Where to Eat

**Brooks Lodge Dining Room** serves three meals daily to lodge guests and is open to campers for individual meals (around $15 to $35 per meal). The menu is hearty Alaskan fare: grilled salmon, prime rib, halibut, and fresh-baked bread. Reservations required for non-lodge guests.

**King Salmon:** Before or after your park visit, **Eddie's Fireplace Inn** in King Salmon offers surprisingly good burgers, steaks, and fried halibut in a classic bush-town atmosphere. Entrees run $18 to $35.

**Antlers Inn Restaurant** in King Salmon serves solid breakfasts and lunch fare, popular with bush pilots and fishing guides. A good place to fuel up before your floatplane ride into Brooks Camp.

**King Ko Inn** rounds out King Salmon's modest dining scene with pizza, sandwiches, and a full bar. It doubles as the social hub for this tiny community of four hundred residents.

**Camp Cooking at Brooks:** Most campers prepare their own meals at the campground cooking shelter. The nearest grocery store is in King Salmon, so plan carefully and pack accordingly. All food must be stored in the bear-resistant cache when not being prepared or consumed.

### Scott's Pro Tips

**Getting There:** Book your floatplane from Anchorage to King Salmon on Ravn Alaska or PenAir well in advance, especially for July travel. From King Salmon, Katmailand operates the floatplane shuttle to Brooks Camp ($224 round trip). Weather delays are common and should be expected. Always build buffer days into your itinerary.

**Best Time to Visit:** July is the iconic month for bears catching leaping salmon at Brooks Falls. But September is arguably better: fewer crowds, fall colors painting the tundra gold and crimson, bears at their fattest before hibernation, and the "Fat Bear Week" competition run by the park. June offers the earliest bear sightings, though salmon have not yet arrived in large numbers.

**Getting Around:** Within Brooks Camp, everything is on foot. The walk from camp to the Falls Platform is about 1.2 miles. Beyond Brooks, travel is by floatplane, boat, or on foot through trailless backcountry. There are no roads within the park.

**Budget Tips:** The campground is by far the cheapest option, but you must win the reservation lottery. Day trips from King Salmon or Homer let you see bears without overnight costs. Book the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes bus tour early as it fills up. Bringing your own fishing gear saves rental fees.

**Safety:** Katmai's bear safety record is excellent, but you must follow all protocols. Maintain a minimum distance of fifty feet from bears at all times (they may approach closer, in which case hold your ground). Never run from a bear. Store all food, trash, and scented items in the bear cache. Carry no food on the trail to the viewing platforms.

**Packing:** Layers are essential, as summer temperatures range from 40 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit with frequent rain. Bring full rain gear (jacket, pants, boot covers), rubber boots or waterproof hiking boots, binoculars, a long camera lens if you have one, insect repellent for mosquitoes, and a headnet. All gear must fit on the floatplane, so pack in soft-sided bags rather than hard luggage.
