Haines occupies one of the most beautiful settings in all of Southeast Alaska, and that is a statement that carries weight in a region defined by beauty. The town of 2,500 sits on a narrow peninsula where the Chilkat and Chilkoot Inlets converge, backed by a semicircle of glacier-draped peaks that catch the morning light and hold it like a cupped hand. From almost any street in town, you can look up and see mountains so dramatically vertical that they seem to lean forward, as if curious about the small human settlement at their feet.

What sets Haines apart from its Southeast Alaska neighbors is access. This is one of only three communities in the region connected to the North American road system, via the spectacular Haines Highway that climbs over Chilkat Pass into Canada's Yukon Territory and eventually joins the Alaska Highway. That road connection gives Haines a character distinct from the island-bound towns of the Inside Passage. There is a self-reliance here, a frontier energy, that comes from knowing you can technically drive to the rest of the continent even if the journey takes days. It also means you can bring your car, your bicycle, your kayak on the roof, and explore at your own pace without relying on tour operators.

The town has cultivated a thriving arts community that punches far above its weight class. Painters, sculptors, woodworkers, and jewelers have been drawn to Haines for decades by the staggering scenery and the affordable cost of living relative to Juneau or Sitka. More than twenty galleries line the streets, and the former Fort William H. Seward, a beautifully preserved military installation from 1904, now houses artists' studios, a performing arts venue, and the Alaska Indian Arts cultural center where master Tlingit carvers create totem poles in a converted hospital building.

But Haines's greatest claim to fame takes flight each fall. From October through February, the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve hosts the largest concentration of bald eagles in the world, with up to four thousand birds gathering along the Chilkat River to feed on a late run of chum salmon sustained by warm upwelling springs that keep the river from freezing. It is one of nature's most astonishing spectacles, and it happens just ten miles up the road from town.

## What Makes Haines Special

The eagle preserve alone would justify a trip to Haines, but the town offers a rare combination that few Alaska destinations can match: world-class wildlife, genuine arts and culture, stunning scenery, road access for independent travelers, and a relaxed pace that feels authentically small-town rather than tourist-manufactured.

Unlike Skagway, thirty minutes away by fast ferry, Haines receives relatively few cruise ship passengers. The town has deliberately chosen a different path, welcoming visitors without letting tourism overwhelm its character. You can walk into a gallery and have a genuine conversation with the artist who created the work on the walls. You can sit at a bar next to a commercial fisherman who has hauled nets in these waters for thirty years. The town feels lived-in, real, and unpretentious in a way that is increasingly hard to find in coastal Alaska.

The Chilkat Valley itself is one of the most scenic drives in the state. The Haines Highway winds through a broad glacial valley flanked by mountains, past the eagle preserve, through stands of cottonwood and spruce, with the Chilkat River braiding silver channels across a wide gravel floodplain. In fall, the cottonwoods turn electric gold against the first snows on the peaks, and the eagles gather like dark punctuation marks in the bare branches.

## Things to Do

**Visit the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve** along the Chilkat River, accessible by car from the Haines Highway between mile 18 and mile 24. Peak eagle concentrations occur from mid-October through mid-December, with November being the best month. Several pullouts offer viewing access, and the Council Grounds area has interpretive signs. Guided tours by local operators run $75 to $125 per person. The preserve is free to visit independently.

**Explore Fort William H. Seward**, the beautifully restored former military post on the south end of town. Wander among the officers' quarters (now B&Bs and residences), visit the Alaska Indian Arts center to watch master Tlingit carvers at work (free admission, donations welcome), and check the schedule at the Chilkat Center for the Arts for performances and events.

**Hike to Rainbow Glacier** on the challenging but rewarding trail that climbs from the Chilkat River valley to stunning alpine views. The round trip is roughly ten miles with 3,500 feet of elevation gain, requiring a full day and good fitness. No fee. For a gentler option, the Battery Point Trail (two miles round trip) offers coastal scenery and tidal pool exploration.

**Kayak Lutak Inlet and Chilkoot Lake** with local outfitters for a chance to paddle beneath eagles and beside spawning salmon. Half-day guided kayaking trips run $125 to $175 per person, with full-day options that include a picnic lunch for around $250.

**Drive the Haines Highway** all the way to the Canadian border and beyond if you have the time. The 150-mile drive to Haines Junction, Yukon, is one of the most spectacular road trips on the continent, climbing through river valleys, past glaciers, over Chilkat Pass at 3,510 feet, and into the vast open landscapes of the Yukon. Carry your passport if crossing into Canada.

**Attend the Southeast Alaska State Fair** in late July or early August, a beloved community event with livestock shows, local food, live music, craft vendors, and a parade that somehow involves the entire town. Admission is around $12 for adults.

## Where to Stay

**Budget:** **Bear Creek Cabins and Hostel** offers dormitory beds for $38 to $45 per night and basic private cabins starting around $95. Located a few miles out of town in a peaceful forest setting, it is the best budget option in Haines. Chilkat State Park campground, seven miles south of town, offers gorgeous waterfront sites for $15 per night with pit toilets and no hookups.

**Mid-Range:** **Hotel Halsingland** at Fort Seward is a charming historic hotel with rooms in the restored officers' quarters. Rates run $160 to $250 per night, and the location amid the fort's grounds is unbeatable. **Captain's Choice Motel** downtown offers reliable, comfortable rooms from $170 to $230 with mountain views.

**Luxury:** **A Sheltered Harbor B&B** and other waterfront bed-and-breakfasts offer elegant rooms with private baths, gourmet breakfasts, and stunning views over the Lynn Canal. Rates range from $275 to $450 per night. For a truly special experience, several vacation rental homes on the outskirts of town provide privacy, mountain views, and full kitchens at $300 to $500 per night.

## Where to Eat

**The Fireweed Restaurant** is Haines's culinary star, serving creative dishes featuring local seafood, garden-fresh produce, and house-baked bread in a warm, art-filled space. The halibut preparations change seasonally and are consistently excellent. Entrees $22 to $42. Reservations recommended in summer.

**Bamboo Room** is a Haines institution that has been feeding locals and visitors since 1953. The breakfast menu is legendary (try the sourdough pancakes), and the pie case is one of the great sights in Southeast Alaska. Breakfast and lunch $10 to $20, dinner entrees $16 to $32.

**Haines Brewing Company** operates a small taproom where you can sample some of the best craft beer in Southeast Alaska. The Spruce Tip Ale is a must-try. Pints $7 to $9, with a food truck often parked outside during summer.

**Mountain Market & Cafe** is the town's natural foods store and cafe, perfect for coffee, sandwiches, smoothies, and baked goods. It doubles as a community hub where you can pick up local event information. Items $5 to $14.

**Mosey's Cantina** serves surprisingly good Mexican food in a casual setting. The fish tacos made with local catch are the standout. Entrees $12 to $22.

### Scott's Pro Tips

**Getting There:** The Alaska Marine Highway ferry from Juneau to Haines takes about 4.5 hours and costs around $50 for a walk-on passenger or $120 with a standard vehicle. Alaska Seaplanes flies from Juneau to Haines in 35 minutes for roughly $150 to $200 one way. If driving, the Haines Highway from Haines Junction, Yukon, is paved and well-maintained, but you will need a passport for the border crossing.

**Best Time to Visit:** June through August for warm weather (50 to 70 degrees), hiking, kayaking, and the arts scene. November for the peak eagle gathering, which is absolutely extraordinary but requires warm clothing and tolerance for short, grey days. Late July for the Southeast Alaska State Fair.

**Getting Around:** Haines is small enough to walk, but a car is essential for the eagle preserve, Chilkat State Park, and the Haines Highway. Rent from local agencies starting around $80 per day. Bicycling is also excellent on the valley roads, with Sockeye Cycle offering rentals and guided tours.

**Budget Tips:** Camp at Chilkat State Park to save on accommodation while enjoying one of the most beautiful campgrounds in Southeast Alaska. Cook your own meals using groceries from Olerud's Market. Time your visit for the shoulder season (May or September) when accommodations drop in price. The best experiences in Haines (eagle watching, fort exploration, trail hiking) are free.

**Safety:** Bear encounters are possible on all trails around Haines, especially near salmon streams in summer and fall. Carry bear spray and make noise while hiking. The Chilkat River has strong currents and cold water temperatures, so only kayak with experienced outfitters or if you have cold-water paddling experience. Weather in Haines can change rapidly, with rain possible any day of the year.

**Packing:** Rain gear is non-negotiable in Southeast Alaska. Bring a quality waterproof jacket and pants, rubber boots or waterproof hiking boots, and layers for temperatures ranging from 40 to 70 degrees in summer. For fall eagle viewing, add a warm insulated jacket, hat, and gloves, as you will be standing still in cold wind along the river. Binoculars are essential for eagle watching, and a telephoto lens will dramatically improve your photos.
