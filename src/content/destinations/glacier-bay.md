There is a moment in Glacier Bay when every sound falls away except the deep, resonant crack of a glacier calving. A wall of ice 200 feet tall shifts, fractures, and collapses into the sea. The splash sends a wave rolling outward that rocks your boat half a mile away. Then the thunder arrives — a booming roar that echoes off the surrounding mountains. It is the sound of geology happening in real time, and it is utterly unforgettable.

Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve protects 3.3 million acres of Southeast Alaska wilderness, including some of the most dramatic and accessible tidewater glaciers on Earth. The park's centerpiece is a Y-shaped bay stretching 65 miles from its mouth near Gustavus to the massive glaciers at its head. Two hundred and fifty years ago, this entire bay was covered by a single glacier thousands of feet thick. The retreat of that ice — one of the most rapid and well-documented glacial retreats in history — has uncovered a living laboratory of ecological succession. Near the bay's mouth, mature spruce and hemlock rainforest thrives. At the upper inlets, bare rock recently freed from ice is just beginning to be colonized by mosses and pioneer plants. In between, every stage of forest development is visible in sequence.

Most visitors experience Glacier Bay from the deck of a cruise ship. Each day, a maximum of two large cruise ships are permitted to enter the bay — a strict limit that keeps the experience remarkably uncrowded given the park's fame. Ships spend a full day cruising the bay's length, lingering at the face of Margerie Glacier and other tidewater glaciers while passengers watch for calving events. It is one of the highlights of any Alaska Inside Passage cruise and one of the rare park experiences that genuinely delivers on its promise.

But Glacier Bay has much more to offer beyond the cruise ship experience. Independent travelers who base themselves in Gustavus — a tiny community of 450 people at the park entrance — can explore on a completely different level. Day boats run deep into the bay for close encounters with glaciers. Multi-day kayaking trips take you into the backcountry inlets where you will share the water with humpback whales, sea otters, and harbor seals hauled out on icebergs. The silence of Glacier Bay experienced from a kayak, with only the distant crackle of shifting ice and the blow of a surfacing whale, is one of the most profound wilderness experiences available in Alaska.

## What Makes Glacier Bay Special

Glacier Bay is a landscape in motion. The glacial retreat here has been so rapid and so recent — only 250 years since the bay was entirely ice-covered — that the park serves as a real-time demonstration of how ecosystems establish themselves on raw terrain. Scientists have studied succession here for over a century, and the park's research programs continue to yield insights into climate change, glaciology, and marine biology.

Seven tidewater glaciers actively calve into the bay. Margerie Glacier, the most visited, presents a mile-wide face of blue-white ice that towers 250 feet above the waterline and extends another 100 feet below. Johns Hopkins Glacier, at the head of its own narrow inlet, is one of the few advancing glaciers in the park and is so actively calving that boats are required to stay at least a quarter mile away. The variety of glacial behavior visible in a single park — advancing, retreating, stable, surging — makes Glacier Bay a globally significant site for understanding how ice responds to changing climate.

The marine environment is equally rich. Glacier Bay's waters support humpback whales, orcas, harbor porpoises, Steller sea lions, sea otters, and harbor seals that pup on floating icebergs near the glaciers. The nutrient upwelling created by tidal mixing and glacial meltwater fuels an extraordinarily productive food chain. Bald eagles patrol the shoreline, and brown and black bears forage along the beaches at low tide.

The Tlingit people have lived in and around Glacier Bay for thousands of years. When the ice advanced roughly 4,000 years ago, Tlingit oral history records the displacement of villages and the loss of ancestral lands to the glacier. The subsequent retreat of the ice and the return of the Huna Tlingit to their homeland is a story of resilience that is woven into the park's interpretation. The Xunaa Shuká Hít (Huna Tribal House) at Bartlett Cove, completed in 2016, stands as a powerful affirmation of the Tlingit connection to this place.

## Things to Do

**Day Boat to Glaciers** — The park concessioner operates daily boats from Bartlett Cove deep into the bay to the tidewater glaciers. The full-day trip (about 8 hours) costs roughly $225-250 per adult and includes a National Park Service ranger on board providing narration. This is the best way for independent travelers to experience the glaciers up close. Whale sightings are common.

**Sea Kayaking** — Glacier Bay is one of the world's premier sea kayaking destinations. Guided day trips from Bartlett Cove cost $150-200 per person and explore the lower bay. Multi-day guided trips into the upper bay run $1,200-2,500 for 3-5 days and bring you to remote glacier faces and wildlife-rich inlets. Glacier Bay Sea Kayaks rents equipment for experienced paddlers planning independent trips.

**Bartlett Cove Trails** — The Forest Loop Trail (1 mile, easy) and the Bartlett River Trail (4 miles round trip, easy) offer accessible walks through coastal rainforest near the lodge. These are free and excellent for birding and bear sightings. The ranger-led walks from the visitor center are informative and also free.

**Whale Watching from Shore** — From the Bartlett Cove beach and the park dock, humpback whales are frequently visible feeding in Bartlett Cove and the lower bay, especially July and August. Bring binoculars and patience. This is free and can be spectacularly productive.

**Gustavus Community** — The tiny town of Gustavus has a quirky, independent character. Rent a bike and explore the flat roads, visit the local farmers market (Saturdays in summer), and stop at the Gustavus Library, which hosts a surprisingly vibrant community. There are no stoplights, no chain stores, and barely any pavement.

**Ranger Programs** — The Park Service runs free evening programs at the Glacier Bay Lodge, daily guided walks, and presentations on the park's natural and cultural history. Check the visitor center for schedules. The ranger talk on glaciology and climate change is particularly compelling.

## Where to Stay

**Budget ($40-80/night)** — The Bartlett Cove Campground is free with a mandatory bear-orientation talk. It has 33 walk-in sites in the rainforest with bear-proof food caches, a warming shelter, and fire rings. This is one of the great free campgrounds in the national park system. In Gustavus, a few vacation rental cabins offer basic accommodations from $80/night.

**Mid-Range ($220-350/night)** — The Glacier Bay Lodge at Bartlett Cove is the only accommodation inside the park. Rooms are comfortable and the setting — surrounded by rainforest at the edge of the bay — is magnificent. The lodge restaurant serves decent food with bay views. Book very early for summer dates. Annie Mae Lodge in Gustavus offers warm hospitality and home-cooked meals.

**Luxury ($500-900/night)** — Bear Track Inn, 7 miles from Gustavus, is an all-inclusive lodge experience with gourmet meals, guided excursions, and a stunning log-and-stone building on a private meadow. Glacier Bay Lodge's premium rooms with bay views approach this tier in setting if not in amenity.

## Where to Eat

**Glacier Bay Lodge Restaurant** — The park's only full-service restaurant serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner with an emphasis on Alaska seafood. Halibut, salmon, and crab feature prominently. Dinner entrees $22-42. The setting overlooking the bay is the real draw. Open mid-May through mid-September.

**The Gustavus Inn** — A renowned small inn that serves communal dinners featuring whatever was caught, picked, or grown that day. The multi-course set dinner ($50-60 per person) is a culinary highlight of Gustavus. Reservations required and often booked weeks ahead.

**Sal's Kitchen** — Casual dining in Gustavus with surprisingly good Mexican-inspired food, fresh fish tacos, and daily specials. Meals $14-22. A welcome change of pace from standard Alaska fare.

**Homeshore Cafe** — A small community gathering spot in Gustavus serving coffee, baked goods, sandwiches, and soup. Perfect for a casual lunch. Items $6-14.

### Scott's Pro Tips for Glacier Bay

**Getting There:** If you are not arriving by cruise ship, fly Alaska Airlines from Juneau to Gustavus (JNU to GST, 30 minutes, $100-200 one-way). A shuttle van meets every flight and drives the 10 miles from the airport to Bartlett Cove ($15). Alternatively, the Glacier Bay day boat runs from Juneau to Gustavus, but this takes longer and is weather-dependent. Reserve all transportation and lodging well in advance — Gustavus has very limited capacity.

**Best Time to Visit:** Mid-June through mid-August is peak season with the warmest temperatures, longest days, and the greatest variety of wildlife. Humpback whale activity peaks in July and August. May and September offer solitude but colder weather and reduced services. The park is technically open year-round, but winter access is extremely limited.

**Getting Around:** Gustavus is flat and bikeable — rent a bike at the lodge or in town. There is a shuttle between Gustavus and Bartlett Cove. Within the park, travel is by boat or kayak. There are no roads into the backcountry. For glacier visits, you are on the day boat or in a kayak.

**Budget Tips:** The free campground at Bartlett Cove is the best deal in the park, but you need to bring all your own food and gear — there is no store in the park and only a tiny one in Gustavus. Pack groceries from Juneau before flying over. The ranger programs are excellent and free. If a full day boat trip is out of your budget, the whale watching from shore at Bartlett Cove is remarkably productive and costs nothing.

**Safety:** The water in Glacier Bay is dangerously cold — a capsize in a kayak is a life-threatening emergency. Wear a dry suit or dry top for any paddling. Bears are present everywhere at Bartlett Cove and throughout the park; the mandatory bear orientation for campers is not a formality. Weather can change rapidly, especially in the upper bay near the glaciers, where katabatic winds (cold air flowing down off the ice) can kick up without warning.

**Packing:** Rain gear is essential — Southeast Alaska averages 60+ inches of precipitation. Bring warm layers for boat trips, as glacier-cooled air can make summer days feel like 40°F on the water. Binoculars are critical for whale watching and glacier viewing. If kayaking, bring a waterproof bag for electronics. Pack all the food you will need from Juneau — provisions in Gustavus are extremely limited and expensive.
