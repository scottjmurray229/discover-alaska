Petersburg is the Southeast Alaska town that the cruise ships forgot, and the locals would like to keep it that way. While nearby Juneau absorbs a million cruise passengers each summer and Ketchikan sells diamonds to visitors who stepped off a floating hotel ten minutes ago, Petersburg goes about its business of catching fish, painting its buildings in bright Norwegian colors, and offering one of the most genuinely authentic small-town experiences in all of coastal Alaska.

The town of roughly three thousand people wraps around a natural harbor on the northern tip of Mitkof Island, surrounded by the dark green immensity of the Tongass National Forest. Its waterfront is dominated not by tourist shops but by working docks where commercial fishing boats unload halibut, salmon, shrimp, and crab destined for markets around the world. Petersburg's fishing fleet is the largest in Southeast Alaska, and the town processes more pounds of seafood annually than most communities ten times its size. The rhythm of the tides, the salmon runs, and the seasonal openings and closures of fishing grounds dictate daily life here in a way that feels increasingly rare in modern America.

The Norwegian heritage is visible everywhere and is not a tourist gimmick. In 1897, Norwegian immigrant Peter Buschmann chose this site for a cannery because the combination of ice from nearby LeConte Glacier, abundant fish, and a protected harbor reminded him of home. He named the settlement after himself, and Norwegian families followed, building a community that maintained its Scandinavian traditions through generations. Today, buildings along Main Street feature rosemaling (traditional Norwegian decorative painting), the Sons of Norway Hall hosts community events, and the Little Norway Festival each May celebrates the town's heritage with costumed parades, traditional foods, and a fish-cleaning contest that draws competitive gutters from across the region.

What gives Petersburg its secret weapon for visitors is LeConte Glacier, the southernmost tidewater glacier in North America. Located just twenty-five miles from town across Frederick Sound, LeConte actively calves icebergs into a narrow bay that resembles a frozen sculpture garden. The journey there by boat passes through waters where humpback whales breach and bubble-net feed, where Steller sea lions haul out on rocky islands, and where the landscape transitions from temperate rainforest to ice-age drama in the span of an hour.

## What Makes Petersburg Special

Petersburg's authenticity is not a marketing strategy; it is a consequence of infrastructure. The town's harbor and channel are too shallow and narrow to accommodate large cruise ships, which means the tidal wave of tourism that has transformed other Southeast Alaska communities simply cannot reach here. Small expedition ships and pocket cruisers visit occasionally, but on any given summer day, the ratio of residents to visitors remains solidly in the residents' favor.

This creates an experience for travelers that is qualitatively different from anywhere else on the Inside Passage. When you walk into a coffee shop in Petersburg, you are surrounded by fishermen, Forest Service employees, school teachers, and artists, not other tourists. When you ask someone for a restaurant recommendation, they give you their honest opinion rather than a rehearsed pitch for a commission-paying establishment. The town is not performing for you. It is simply being itself, and that self happens to be fascinating.

Frederick Sound, the broad waterway that lies between Petersburg and the mainland, is one of the most productive marine ecosystems in Southeast Alaska. Humpback whales gather here in remarkable numbers from June through September to feed on herring and krill, and the bubble-net feeding displays, where groups of whales work together to corral fish into a column of bubbles before lunging upward through the surface with mouths agape, are among the most spectacular wildlife behaviors visible anywhere. Several Petersburg-based operators run whale-watching tours, and the relatively uncrowded waters mean you are unlikely to share a sighting with a dozen other boats.

The Stikine River Delta, accessible by boat from Petersburg, is another world entirely: a vast wetland where the Stikine River, one of the largest free-flowing rivers in North America, meets the sea. In spring, the delta hosts millions of migrating shorebirds and the largest gathering of bald eagles in Southeast Alaska outside of Haines. The Stikine River itself is a corridor into the British Columbia interior, and jet boat tours upriver visit natural hot springs, bear viewing areas, and the historic site of the Stikine gold rush.

## Things to Do

**LeConte Glacier Tour** is the premier Petersburg activity. Local operators like Tongass Kayak Adventures and Viking Travel run boat tours to LeConte Bay, where you can view the tidewater glacier calving icebergs into the fjord. The journey includes whale watching, sea lion viewing, and stunning mountain scenery. Full-day tours run $250 to $350 per person. Half-day options are sometimes available for around $200.

**Whale Watching in Frederick Sound** is exceptional from June through September. Guided trips cost $200 to $300 per person for a half-day, and sightings are nearly guaranteed during peak season. Humpback whale bubble-net feeding is a specialty of these waters and an experience that marine biologists travel from around the world to study.

**Walk Petroglyph Beach**, a state historic park just a mile north of downtown, where ancient petroglyphs carved by Tlingit people are visible on rocks along the shoreline. The carvings, some estimated at thousands of years old, depict spirals, faces, and fish. Best viewed at low tide. Free.

**Hike the Raven's Roost Trail**, a strenuous but rewarding 4-mile climb that ascends from sea level to an alpine cabin at 1,800 feet elevation, with panoramic views of Frederick Sound, the Coast Range, and the town far below. The free-use Forest Service cabin at the top can be reserved for overnight stays ($45 per night through recreation.gov). The trail is steep and muddy, requiring good boots and reasonable fitness.

**Explore Downtown Petersburg** on foot, admiring the rosemaling on buildings along Main Street, browsing the Clausen Memorial Museum ($5 admission) for an excellent overview of local history and culture, and visiting Sing Lee Alley, a boardwalk built over the tidal flats that leads to shops and galleries.

**Kayak the Petersburg waterfront and surrounding islands** with local outfitters. Half-day guided paddles start at $100 per person, while multi-day trips into the LeConte Bay area or Thomas Bay run $400 to $900 depending on duration.

## Where to Stay

**Budget:** **Ohmer Creek Campground**, managed by the Forest Service about twenty-two miles south of town on Mitkof Highway, offers beautiful forest campsites for $10 per night. Closer to town, the **Tent City** area near the waterfront has historically offered basic camping options, though availability and rules change, so check locally. Budget-minded travelers can also find occasional Airbnb rooms starting around $100 per night.

**Mid-Range:** **Scandia House** is Petersburg's main downtown hotel, offering comfortable rooms within walking distance of everything. Rates run $140 to $220 per night. The hotel's central location and helpful front desk staff make it the natural choice for most visitors. Several B&Bs in the $150 to $250 range provide more personal experiences with local hosts.

**Luxury:** **Nordic House B&B** and other upscale bed-and-breakfasts offer waterfront or mountain-view rooms with gourmet breakfasts and local knowledge that no hotel can match. Rates range from $225 to $375 per night. For a wilderness experience, Forest Service cabins in the surrounding Tongass National Forest offer rustic luxury through solitude, at $45 to $75 per night (book far in advance on recreation.gov).

## Where to Eat

**Inga's Galley** is a beloved local spot for seafood, burgers, and daily specials that reflect what the fleet just brought in. The fish and chips use halibut that was swimming hours before it reached your plate. Entrees $14 to $28.

**The Salty Pantry** serves creative sandwiches, soups, salads, and baked goods made with local and seasonal ingredients. The smoked salmon chowder is outstanding. Perfect for a waterfront lunch. Items $9 to $18.

**Papa Bear's Pizza** is the go-to casual dinner spot, serving pizzas, calzones, and pasta in a family-friendly setting. The seafood pizza with local shrimp is a local favorite. Pizzas $16 to $28.

**Coastal Cold Storage** is not a restaurant but a fish market and deli on the harbor where you can buy freshly caught and smoked fish to go, along with shrimp, crab, and prepared salads. If you have a kitchen or a campsite, this is the place to shop. Market prices vary but fresh halibut typically runs $18 to $25 per pound.

**Helse Cafe** serves coffee, breakfast burritos, and light fare in a cheerful space that draws a loyal local following. The Norwegian-inspired pastries and fresh-roasted coffee make it the best morning stop in town. Items $5 to $14.

### Scott's Pro Tips

**Getting There:** Alaska Airlines flies jet service to Petersburg from Juneau and Sitka, with fares typically $150 to $300 one way. The Alaska Marine Highway ferry is a scenic alternative: the southbound route from Juneau passes through the Wrangell Narrows, a twenty-two-mile stretch of channel so narrow that trees brush the deck, which the ferry navigates day or night with the skill of a thread through a needle. Walk-on fares from Juneau run about $55.

**Best Time to Visit:** June through August for the best weather, whale watching, and glacier tours. May is gorgeous with fewer visitors and the Little Norway Festival. September offers fall colors and continued whale activity but cooler weather and reduced services. Winter is quiet and cold, but the fishing community keeps the town alive year-round, unlike some seasonal tourist towns.

**Getting Around:** Petersburg is compact and walkable, with downtown, the harbor, and most services within a fifteen-minute walk of each other. For trailheads, the airport, and sites along Mitkof Highway, rent a car from Scandia House or local agencies (around $75 to $100 per day). Taxis are available but limited.

**Budget Tips:** Petersburg is one of the more affordable Southeast Alaska towns because it has not developed the premium tourist pricing of Juneau or Skagway. Buy fresh fish at Coastal Cold Storage and cook it yourself for a fraction of restaurant prices. Petroglyph Beach, downtown walking, and many trailheads are free. The ferry from Wrangell or Juneau is cheaper than flying and doubles as a scenic tour.

**Safety:** Bear awareness is important on all trails around Petersburg. Carry bear spray and make noise while hiking. The Tongass Forest trails are frequently wet and muddy, so good footwear prevents injuries. If kayaking, be aware that tidal currents in the Narrows are swift, and cold water requires appropriate gear. Weather in Southeast Alaska changes rapidly; always carry rain gear even on clear mornings.

**Packing:** Rain gear is the single most important thing you will pack for Petersburg. A quality waterproof jacket, rain pants, and rubber boots or waterproof hiking boots are essential. Layers for 45 to 65 degree summer temperatures. Binoculars for whale watching and glacier viewing. A camera with a telephoto lens for wildlife. And bring a reusable bag for fish purchases at Coastal Cold Storage, because you will not be able to resist bringing home some of the freshest seafood you have ever tasted.
