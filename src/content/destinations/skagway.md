# Skagway: Where the Gold Rush Lives On

There is a particular quality of light in Skagway on a clear summer morning — sharp, golden, almost theatrical — that makes the restored Victorian facades of Broadway Street look like a film set. But Skagway is no replica. This narrow corridor of civilization, wedged between sheer granite mountains at the head of the Lynn Canal, is the genuine article: a town that sprang into existence almost overnight in 1897 when tens of thousands of gold-crazed stampeders poured off steamships and began the brutal climb over White Pass and the Chilkoot Trail toward the Klondike goldfields. At its frenzied peak, Skagway was the largest city in Alaska, home to somewhere between 8,000 and 10,000 people, along with con men, dance hall girls, and the notorious gangster Soapy Smith. Today, the year-round population hovers around 1,200, but the spirit of that wild era saturates every weathered board and rusted rail spike.

The entire downtown is preserved as part of the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park, managed by the National Park Service. Rangers in period dress lead walking tours past the original Arctic Brotherhood Hall with its driftwood-stick facade, the Mascot Saloon, and the restored railroad depot. Unlike many historic districts that feel sanitized, Skagway retains a rough-edged authenticity. The mountains press in on all sides, the wind funnels down the valley with surprising force, and the scale of the landscape makes the town's ambition — and the stampeders' desperation — immediately, viscerally comprehensible.

But Skagway is more than a history lesson. The White Pass & Yukon Route Railway, an engineering marvel completed in 1900, still runs scenic excursions up the precipitous pass, climbing 2,865 feet in just 20 miles through tunnels blasted from solid granite. The Chilkoot Trail, the stampeders' original route, remains one of the great multi-day hikes in North America. And Skagway's position at the northern tip of the Inside Passage, connected by road to the Yukon and British Columbia, gives it a frontier-crossroads character unlike anywhere else in Southeast Alaska.

What strikes most visitors is the contrast between the tiny town and the enormous landscape surrounding it. Step two blocks off Broadway in any direction and you are at the edge of wilderness. Waterfalls cascade down mountainsides visible from Main Street. Mountain goats pick their way across cliffs above the harbor. Skagway is civilization at its most concentrated and most precarious, a small human settlement that exists only because the mountains allowed a single narrow passage through.

## What Makes Skagway Special

Skagway is the only town in Southeast Alaska connected to the road system, via the Klondike Highway to Whitehorse and the Alaska Highway. This gives it a dual identity: it is both a Southeast Alaskan port town and a road-trip destination. The convergence of railroad, trail, highway, and ocean creates a layered travel experience available nowhere else in the state. You can ride a historic narrow-gauge railway in the morning, hike to an alpine lake in the afternoon, and drive into Canada for dinner — all from a town you can walk across in ten minutes. The Gold Rush history is exceptional, but it is this intersection of access and wilderness that truly sets Skagway apart.

## Things to Do

**White Pass & Yukon Route Railway** — The signature Skagway experience. The classic Summit Excursion takes 3 hours round-trip to White Pass summit and back, with staggering views of Bridal Veil Falls, Dead Horse Gulch, and the original Trail of '98. Adult tickets run $135-$155. Longer trips to Fraser, BC or Lake Bennett are available for $170-$235. Book well in advance for summer dates.

**Chilkoot Trail** — This legendary 33-mile backpacking route from Dyea (9 miles from Skagway) to Lake Bennett follows the exact path of the 1897-98 Gold Rush stampeders. The 3-5 day hike crosses the Chilkoot Pass at 3,525 feet and passes through coastal rainforest, alpine tundra, and boreal forest. Permits are required and limited; book through Parks Canada ($55 CAD reservation fee plus $12 CAD per night). This is a serious wilderness trek requiring strong fitness and backcountry experience.

**Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park** — Free ranger-led walking tours of the historic district run multiple times daily in summer. The visitor center on Broadway has excellent exhibits, a film, and a well-stocked bookstore. Junior Ranger programs are available for kids. All free.

**Dewey Lakes Trail System** — For day hikers, the trail to Lower Dewey Lake is an easy 0.7-mile walk from downtown. The trail to Upper Dewey Lake is a more strenuous 3.5-mile climb with 3,100 feet of elevation gain, rewarding hikers with stunning alpine scenery. Free.

**Yukon Suspension Bridge & White Pass Summit** — Drive or take a tour to the White Pass summit area, where the Yukon Suspension Bridge spans a dramatic gorge. Admission is $15-$20 per person. Combine with a drive along the beautiful Klondike Highway toward Carcross, Yukon.

**Gold Panning & Museum Visits** — Several outfits in town offer gold-panning experiences ($20-$40 per person) that are particularly fun for families. The Skagway Museum ($5) houses an excellent collection of Gold Rush artifacts, Tlingit art, and natural history exhibits.

**Dyea Ghost Town & Slide Cemetery** — Drive the gravel road 9 miles to Dyea, the rival town to Skagway that served as the Chilkoot Trail's trailhead. Almost nothing remains except a few pilings and the haunting Slide Cemetery, where 60+ victims of the 1898 Palm Sunday avalanche are buried. Free and deeply moving.

## Where to Stay

**Budget** — The Skagway Mountain View RV Park and Pullen Creek RV Park offer tent sites for $20-$35 per night. The Sergeant Preston's Lodge has basic rooms starting around $95-$130 per night. For backpackers, the Dyea area has free dispersed camping.

**Mid-Range** — The Westmark Inn Skagway, a classic Alaska hotel, offers comfortable rooms in the $180-$260 range during summer. At the Skagway Inn, a restored 1897 Victorian boarding house, rooms run $160-$240 with genuine period character.

**Luxury** — The historic Hotel & Spirits at the Skagway Brewing Company offers well-appointed rooms for $250-$400 per night. For a unique experience, the White Pass Train Car Lodgings let you sleep in a restored 1900s-era train car for $300-$450 per night.

## Where to Eat

**Skagway Brewing Company** — The town's best restaurant, serving craft beers brewed on-site alongside hearty pub fare: bison burgers, fish and chips, and smoked salmon chowder. Entrees $16-$30. The Spruce Tip Blonde Ale is excellent.

**Starfire** — A Thai and American fusion restaurant on Broadway with surprisingly good pad thai and curries alongside Alaska seafood dishes. A welcome departure from standard tourist fare. Entrees $14-$26.

**The Bonanza Bar and Grill** — A lively spot with a frontier saloon atmosphere, solid burgers, and live music on summer evenings. Casual meals $12-$22.

**Glacial Smoothies & Espresso** — A perfect breakfast and coffee stop. Fresh smoothies, pastries, and espresso drinks. Light meals $6-$14. Popular with hikers fueling up for the trail.

**Skagway Fish Company** — Right on the harbor, this casual seafood shack serves fresh halibut, salmon, and crab. Fish tacos and chowder bowls are the move. Meals $14-$28.

## Scott's Pro Tips

**Getting There:** Most visitors arrive by cruise ship or Alaska Marine Highway ferry from Juneau (4.5 hours) or Haines (45 minutes). If you have a vehicle, the Klondike Highway from Whitehorse, Yukon is a spectacular 110-mile drive. Skagway also has a small airport with charter flights, but no scheduled commercial service. The fast ferry from Haines is an excellent day-trip option.

**Best Time to Visit:** June through August is prime season with the longest days and warmest weather. May and September are quieter with lower prices but some services may be closed. The Chilkoot Trail is typically snow-free from late June through mid-September. Cruise ship days (mainly May-September) bring thousands of visitors; if you are staying in town, enjoy the quieter mornings and evenings.

**Getting Around:** Skagway's downtown is tiny and entirely walkable. To reach Dyea, you will need a car, bicycle, or shuttle ($15-$25). Rental cars are available through local agencies. The Klondike Highway is well-maintained and makes a great self-drive excursion toward Carcross and Whitehorse. Bring your passport if you plan to cross into Canada.

**Budget Tips:** The National Park Service ranger programs are free and outstanding — arguably the best value in Skagway. Hiking the Dewey Lakes trail system costs nothing and delivers incredible scenery. If the White Pass Railway is too expensive, drive the Klondike Highway yourself for free and get many of the same views. Pack lunches from the grocery store to offset restaurant costs.

**Safety:** Weather in Skagway can shift rapidly. The valley acts as a wind funnel, and gusts can be surprisingly strong, especially in spring and fall. If hiking the Chilkoot Trail, be prepared for snow at the pass even in July, and take bear precautions (carry spray and use bear-proof food storage). The road to Dyea is gravel with some steep sections — drive cautiously. Bears frequent the Dyea flats, especially during salmon season.

**Packing:** Layers are essential — mornings can be cool and afternoons warm in the same day. A windproof jacket is important given the valley winds. For the Chilkoot Trail, full backpacking gear is required including rain gear, warm layers, and a camp stove. Bring a passport if you plan to cross into Canada by road or on the extended railway excursions. Comfortable walking shoes are sufficient for exploring downtown, but hiking boots are needed for the Dewey Lakes and Chilkoot trails.
