Anchorage is the rare city where you can catch a salmon in the morning, browse world-class art over lunch, and spot a moose on your evening jog — all without leaving the municipality. Nestled on a coastal plain between the Chugach Mountains and the waters of Cook Inlet, Alaska's largest city is a paradox that works: a modern urban center of nearly 300,000 people surrounded by genuine, untamed wilderness on every side.

Most visitors treat Anchorage as a layover, a brief stop on the way to Denali or the Kenai Peninsula. That is a mistake. The city rewards those who linger. Spend a few days here and you will find a place with a distinct cultural identity — shaped by its Indigenous heritage, military history, and the independent spirit of people who choose to live at 61 degrees north latitude. The restaurant scene has evolved well beyond the moose-burger-and-sourdough cliches, the trail system rivals any city in North America, and the arts community punches far above its weight.

The setting alone justifies a visit. On a clear day, Denali is visible from downtown, a white crown floating 130 miles to the north. The Chugach front range rises directly behind the city, offering alpine hiking within a fifteen-minute drive of your hotel. Beluga whales surface in Turnagain Arm. Bald eagles perch on lampposts. This is not marketing embellishment — it is Tuesday in Anchorage.

Whether you are beginning a grand Alaska road trip or carving out time for the city itself, Anchorage delivers a concentration of experiences that no other place in the state can match. It is the only Alaska city with a genuine urban infrastructure — ride-share services, a reliable bus system, diverse international dining — while still being a place where bears occasionally wander through suburban yards.

## What Makes Anchorage Special

Anchorage sits at the crossroads of Alaska. It is the state's transportation hub, economic engine, and cultural melting pot. More than 100 languages are spoken in the Anchorage School District, making it one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the United States. This diversity shows up in the food, the festivals, and the fabric of daily life.

The city's geography is extraordinary. The municipality covers nearly 2,000 square miles — larger than Rhode Island — and includes everything from downtown high-rises to backcountry glaciers. The 11-mile Tony Knowles Coastal Trail runs from downtown along the shore of Knik Arm, passing through moose habitat, past floatplane lakes, and alongside mud flats where bore tides roll in from the ocean. Flattop Mountain, the most-climbed peak in Alaska, offers panoramic views of the city, the Inlet, and on clear days, the Alaska Range.

Anchorage also carries the scars and stories of the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake, the most powerful ever recorded in North America at magnitude 9.2. Earthquake Park preserves the landslide bluffs created that day, and interpretive signs tell the story of the destruction and rebuilding that followed.

## Things to Do

**Tony Knowles Coastal Trail** — Walk, run, or bike this paved 11-mile trail from downtown to Kincaid Park. Bike rentals are available near the trailhead at 2nd Avenue for about $35-45 per day. Watch for moose, especially in spring and fall.

**Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center** — Located 50 miles south on the Seward Highway, this refuge houses bears, moose, bison, musk oxen, and other animals that cannot survive in the wild. Admission is $15 for adults, $10 for children. Worth the drive, especially combined with the stunning Turnagain Arm scenery along the way.

**Flattop Mountain Hike** — The trailhead is a 20-minute drive from downtown in Chugach State Park. The 1.5-mile trail gains 1,350 feet and rewards with 360-degree views. Parking requires an Alaska State Parks pass ($5 daily). Free in winter, though crampons are essential.

**Anchorage Museum** — The state's finest museum covers Alaska Native cultures, Arctic science, and contemporary art. The Smithsonian Arctic Studies Center houses 600 Alaska Native artifacts. Admission is $20 for adults. Allow at least 2-3 hours.

**Ship Creek Salmon Viewing** — From June through September, king and silver salmon run up Ship Creek right in downtown Anchorage. You can fish here with a one-day non-resident license ($25) or simply watch from the viewing platform.

**Flightseeing** — Several operators at Lake Hood, the world's busiest floatplane base, offer scenic flights over glaciers, Denali, and Prince William Sound. Expect $200-350 per person for a 60-90 minute flight. Rust's Flying Service and Regal Air are well-established operators.

**Alyeska Resort and Tram** — Forty miles south in Girdwood, ride the aerial tram to 2,300 feet for glacier and ocean views. Tram tickets are $35 for adults. The mountaintop restaurant, Seven Glaciers, is one of Alaska's finest dining experiences.

## Where to Stay

**Budget ($80-130/night)** — The Bent Prop Inn & Hostel in Midtown offers clean dorms and private rooms. Base Camp Anchorage is a well-reviewed hostel with a communal kitchen. For camping, Centennial Campground near the Anchorage Museum operates from late May through September at $40/night.

**Mid-Range ($180-280/night)** — The Lakefront Anchorage (formerly the Millennium) sits on the shore of Lake Spenard near the floatplane base and offers solid rooms with mountain views. The Anchorage Grand Hotel downtown provides apartment-style suites with kitchens, ideal for families.

**Luxury ($350-700/night)** — Hotel Captain Cook is the city's landmark luxury property, with three towers overlooking Cook Inlet and a classic old-Alaska elegance. The Alyeska Resort in Girdwood, 40 miles south, is a full mountain resort with a ski-in restaurant, spa, and aerial tram.

## Where to Eat

**Moose's Tooth Pub & Pizzeria** — Consistently ranked among the best pizza in the US, this local institution serves creative pies and house-brewed beer. The apricot chicken pizza is legendary. Expect a 30-60 minute wait on weekends. Pizzas run $16-28.

**Snow City Cafe** — The go-to breakfast spot downtown. Lines form early on weekends for dishes like king crab eggs Benedict and reindeer sausage scrambles. Entrees $14-22.

**Simon & Seafort's** — An Anchorage classic perched above Cook Inlet with sweeping views of the Alaska Range. Known for seafood and steaks. Dinner entrees $30-55. Reservations recommended.

**Spenard Roadhouse** — A beloved neighborhood restaurant in the funky Spenard district. Brunch is outstanding, and the rotating seasonal menu leans on local ingredients. Entrees $18-35.

**Yak & Yeti** — Authentic Himalayan and Indian cuisine that reflects Anchorage's diverse population. Generous portions, reasonable prices ($14-20 entrees), and a loyal local following.

### Scott's Pro Tips for Anchorage

**Getting There:** Fly into ANC — it is a major hub with competitive fares from the Lower 48, especially on Alaska Airlines and Delta. If driving from the Kenai Peninsula or Fairbanks, the highways into town are straightforward but watch for moose, especially at dawn and dusk.

**Best Time to Visit:** Late June through mid-August delivers the warmest weather and longest days. September brings fall colors, smaller crowds, and lower prices but shorter days. Winter visitors come for the Fur Rendezvous festival in February and the Iditarod ceremonial start in early March.

**Getting Around:** Rent a car. Anchorage is spread out, and you will want to explore the Seward Highway corridor, Girdwood, and Chugach State Park. Uber and Lyft operate in Anchorage but can be unreliable outside downtown. The People Mover bus system covers the main corridors but is slow.

**Budget Tips:** Buy groceries at Costco or Fred Meyer rather than eating every meal out — restaurant prices are 20-30% higher than the Lower 48. The city's best attractions — trails, salmon viewing, and scenic drives — are free. Get an annual Alaska State Parks pass ($60) if you plan to hike more than a few times.

**Safety:** Moose are the most common safety concern. Never approach them. A cow with calves will charge. Bears are present in Chugach State Park and occasionally in town — carry bear spray on hikes. Turnagain Arm mud flats look walkable but are quicksand-like glacial silt that has trapped and killed people.

**Packing:** Layers are essential even in summer. A morning can start at 50°F, warm to 70°F by afternoon, and drop again by evening. Bring a waterproof shell, sturdy hiking shoes, sunglasses, and sunscreen — at this latitude, summer UV is surprisingly intense during 19-hour days.
