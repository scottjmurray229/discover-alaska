# Valdez: The Glacier-Carved Jewel of Prince William Sound

The approach to Valdez is one of the great drives in Alaska, and that is saying something in a state where every highway seems to traffic in superlatives. Coming from Anchorage on the Richardson Highway, you cross Thompson Pass at 2,678 feet — one of the snowiest places in Alaska, where the annual snowfall regularly exceeds 300 inches — then plunge through Keystone Canyon, a narrow rock gorge where Bridal Veil Falls and Horsetail Falls cascade hundreds of feet down sheer cliff faces just feet from the roadside. The canyon opens, the mountains part, and suddenly Valdez appears below: a compact grid of streets nestled on the shore of Port Valdez, an arm of Prince William Sound so deeply carved by glaciers that it looks more like a Norwegian fjord than an Alaskan harbor.

The nickname "Little Switzerland" is earned. Valdez is enclosed on nearly every side by mountains of staggering scale and steepness, their flanks streaked with waterfalls in summer and buried under massive snowfields in winter. The Chugach Mountains here are young, aggressive, and alive with glacial activity. Columbia Glacier, one of the largest tidewater glaciers in North America, lies just 25 miles to the west, calving house-sized icebergs into the sound with thunderous regularity. The landscape around Valdez is not gentle or pastoral — it is dramatic, vertical, and deeply powerful.

Valdez occupies an unusual place in Alaska's modern history. The original town, established in the 1890s as a gateway for prospectors heading to the Interior, was completely destroyed by the 1964 Good Friday earthquake — the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in North America. A massive underwater landslide triggered a tsunami that obliterated the waterfront, killing 32 people. The entire town was relocated four miles to its present site, making modern Valdez one of Alaska's newest communities, built from scratch on engineered ground. Then, in 1977, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was completed, with Valdez as its southern terminus. Oil from Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Coast travels 800 miles through the pipeline to the Valdez Marine Terminal, where tankers load crude for refineries down south. The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, which occurred when a tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, brought the town unwanted international fame and triggered one of the most significant environmental disasters in American history. Today, Prince William Sound has largely recovered, and Valdez has emerged as one of Southcentral Alaska's most compelling destinations.

The town itself is quiet and unassuming — a few thousand people who fish, work the pipeline terminal, run adventure tourism operations, and endure winters that would break most communities. But the access that Valdez provides to Prince William Sound, the Chugach Mountains, and the surrounding glaciers is extraordinary. This is a place where you can cruise to a tidewater glacier in the morning, kayak among icebergs in the afternoon, and hike to a waterfall before dinner — all without leaving the road system.

## What Makes Valdez Special

Valdez is Prince William Sound's most accessible port. While Whittier provides a tunnel-dependent gateway to the western Sound, Valdez sits at the eastern end with open road access year-round via the Richardson Highway. This makes it the natural base for exploring a marine environment that many consider the most beautiful in Alaska: a complex maze of fjords, islands, glaciers, and protected waters teeming with marine life. The combination of maritime access, extreme mountain terrain, and documented history — from Gold Rush to earthquake to pipeline — gives Valdez a narrative depth that enriches every outdoor experience.

## Things to Do

**Columbia Glacier Cruise** — A full-day boat tour to Columbia Glacier is the highlight of any Valdez visit. The cruise navigates through Prince William Sound past sea otters, harbor seals hauled out on icebergs, and puffin colonies, culminating at the face of the glacier itself — a wall of blue ice 3 miles wide and 300 feet tall. Tours run $150-$200 per person for 6-8 hours. Operators include Stan Stephens Glacier & Wildlife Cruises and Lu-Lu Belle Glacier Wildlife Cruises.

**Keystone Canyon & Waterfalls** — Just 12 miles from town on the Richardson Highway, Keystone Canyon features Bridal Veil Falls and Horsetail Falls, both visible from roadside pullouts. The canyon is also a popular site for ice climbing in winter. In summer, commercial rafting trips through the canyon on the Lowe River offer Class III-IV rapids for $55-$75 per person. Free to view the waterfalls.

**Prince William Sound Kayaking** — Guided sea kayaking trips explore the protected waters around Valdez, paddling among icebergs, past sea otter rafts, and along wild coastlines. Day trips run $100-$175 per person. Multi-day expeditions to remote camps in the sound cost $400-$800 per person and offer deeper immersion in one of Alaska's most pristine marine environments.

**Worthington Glacier State Recreation Site** — Located at Thompson Pass, 28 miles from Valdez, this roadside glacier allows you to walk right up to the ice face on a short trail. It is one of the most accessible glaciers in Alaska and completely free. The drive to the pass traverses some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in the state.

**Valdez Museum & Historical Archive** — Two excellent museum sites tell the story of Valdez from the Ahtna Athabascan people through the Gold Rush, the 1964 earthquake, and the pipeline era. The main museum downtown charges $9 for adults. The Annex features a 1:20 scale model of Old Valdez before the earthquake — a remarkable and moving exhibit.

**Fishing** — Valdez harbor is a starting point for excellent silver and pink salmon fishing (July-September) and halibut fishing (May-August). The Allison Point fishery, accessible from the road system, offers combat-style shore fishing for pink and silver salmon during peak runs — no charter needed. Charters for halibut and salmon run $275-$400 per person for a full day.

**Thompson Pass Heli-Skiing** — For winter visitors, Valdez is the undisputed heli-skiing capital of Alaska. Operators like Valdez Heli-Ski Guides access the Chugach Mountains' deep powder and extreme terrain from January through April. Packages start at $1,500-$2,000 per day. This is expert-level skiing in serious avalanche terrain — not for beginners.

## Where to Stay

**Budget** — The Bear Paw Camper Park has tent and RV sites for $25-$45 per night right in town. Allison Point Campground ($15-$20 per night) sits on the shore near the terminal, with salmon fishing steps from your tent. The Valdez Glacier Campground ($15) offers stunning glacier views.

**Mid-Range** — The Mountain Sky Hotel & Suites offers modern rooms for $190-$280 per night. The Best Western Valdez Harbor Inn has waterfront rooms for $200-$300. Keystone Hotel, closer to downtown, runs $170-$250. All are within walking distance of restaurants and the harbor.

**Luxury** — For a premium experience, the Robe Lake Lodge offers waterfront cabins for $300-$450 per night. Remote wilderness lodges in Prince William Sound, such as Growler Island Camp, provide all-inclusive kayak and wildlife adventures for $500-$700 per person per night with guided excursions.

## Where to Eat

**The Fat Mermaid** — Valdez's best-known restaurant, perched on the harbor with outdoor seating overlooking the boat docks. Fresh halibut, salmon, and seafood tacos are the specialties. The fish and chips are legendary. Entrees $16-$34.

**Mike's Palace** — A Valdez institution since the pipeline construction era, serving Italian-American food with generous portions. The pizza and lasagna are local favorites, and the salad bar is surprisingly robust. Entrees $14-$32.

**Ernesto's Taqueria** — A small but mighty Mexican spot serving burritos, tacos, and enchiladas that hit the spot after a day on the water. Fresh, flavorful, and affordable. Meals $10-$18.

**Old Town Burgers** — A casual burger joint with hand-formed patties, milkshakes, and fries. The halibut burger is a Valdez classic. Meals $12-$20.

**Rogue's Garden Bistro** — A newer addition to the Valdez dining scene, featuring farm-inspired cuisine with local ingredients, craft cocktails, and a rotating seasonal menu. Entrees $18-$36.

## Scott's Pro Tips

**Getting There:** The drive from Anchorage to Valdez (305 miles, 5.5 hours) traverses three stunning mountain passes and is one of Alaska's great road trips. The Glenn Highway to Glennallen passes through the Matanuska Valley, and the Richardson Highway from Glennallen to Valdez crosses Thompson Pass with jaw-dropping scenery. The road is paved and well-maintained year-round, though winter conditions at Thompson Pass can be severe. Ravn Alaska flies from Anchorage to Valdez ($200-$350 round trip). The Alaska Marine Highway ferry connects Valdez to Whittier and Cordova.

**Best Time to Visit:** June through August is peak season with the warmest weather and all tours operating. July brings peak pink salmon runs and the longest days. August offers silver salmon fishing and slightly smaller crowds. May and September are shoulder months with lower prices and excellent scenery — fall colors in September along the Richardson Highway are spectacular. Winter visitors come for heli-skiing (February-April) and ice climbing in Keystone Canyon.

**Getting Around:** A car is valuable for exploring the Richardson Highway corridor, Thompson Pass, and Worthington Glacier. The town itself is walkable, and the harbor area where most tours depart is compact. Rental cars are available but limited — book well in advance for summer. Bike rentals are an option for exploring town and nearby trails. All boat tours and kayak trips depart from the small boat harbor downtown.

**Budget Tips:** Worthington Glacier and Keystone Canyon are free and among the most impressive roadside attractions in Alaska. Shore fishing at Allison Point requires only a fishing license. The Valdez Museum is inexpensive and excellent. Camp at one of the several campgrounds in the area to save significantly on lodging. Pack lunch for glacier cruises — most boats allow you to bring food. The town's public library offers free WiFi and a warm, dry place to relax.

**Safety:** Prince William Sound weather can change rapidly — dress warmly for boat tours even on sunny days, as temperatures on the water are significantly cooler than on shore. If sea kayaking, understand tidal patterns and stay alert for calving glaciers, which can generate dangerous waves. The road over Thompson Pass requires caution in any season — check conditions before driving, especially from October through April. Bears are present throughout the Valdez area; carry bear spray when hiking. The Allison Point fishing area attracts bears during salmon runs — be aware and keep a clean camp.

**Packing:** Layer up for maritime weather: a waterproof shell, fleece mid-layer, and moisture-wicking base layer are essential. Bring warm gloves and a hat for glacier cruises, even in July — calving ice creates cold winds. Rubber boots or waterproof hiking boots are recommended. Binoculars enhance every boat tour and wildlife experience. If driving from Anchorage, bring snacks and water for the road — services between Glennallen and Valdez are very limited. For winter heli-skiing, operators provide avalanche safety equipment, but bring your own high-performance cold-weather ski gear.
