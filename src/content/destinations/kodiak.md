# Kodiak: Alaska's Emerald Isle

From the air, Kodiak Island is a revelation. After the glaciated peaks and ice-scoured granite of the mainland, Kodiak's rolling green mountains and deeply indented coastline look almost Irish — lush, emerald, impossibly verdant. This is the second-largest island in the United States (after Hawai'i's Big Island), a 3,588-square-mile mass of mountains, rivers, tidal flats, and old-growth spruce forest rising from the turbulent waters where the North Pacific meets the Gulf of Alaska. There are no glaciers here, no permafrost, no tundra in the conventional sense. Instead, Kodiak occupies its own ecological niche: a maritime island where Pacific storms deliver 60-80 inches of annual rainfall, turning the hillsides into carpets of green that glow under the long summer light.

The island is most famous for its bears. Kodiak brown bears — a subspecies of grizzly isolated on the archipelago for roughly 12,000 years — are the largest land-based predators on Earth, with mature males regularly exceeding 1,000 pounds and occasionally reaching 1,500. An estimated 3,500 bears roam the Kodiak archipelago, outnumbering people in many areas. The Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, encompassing the southern two-thirds of the island, was established specifically to protect these animals and their habitat. Bear viewing is a major draw, though the logistics are different from mainland operations — Kodiak's bears are spread across a vast roadless wilderness, making bush plane or boat access essential for most viewing locations.

But Kodiak is far more than a bear sanctuary. The town of Kodiak, clustered around St. Paul Harbor on the island's northeastern shore, is the center of one of the most productive commercial fishing fleets in the world. The harbor bristles with crab boats, longliners, seiners, and trawlers that pursue king crab, salmon, halibut, pollock, and Pacific cod across some of the roughest waters on the planet. If you have ever watched Deadliest Catch, many of those boats call Kodiak home. The Coast Guard's largest base, Support Center Kodiak, occupies the former WWII naval air station nearby, and military and fishing culture together give the town a hardworking, no-nonsense character that feels distinctly different from the tourist-oriented ports of Southeast Alaska.

Kodiak also carries a layered human history that few places in Alaska can match. The Alutiiq (Sugpiaq) people have inhabited the archipelago for at least 7,500 years, and their cultural revival is one of the most dynamic Indigenous heritage movements in the state. Russian fur traders established a permanent settlement here in 1784, making Kodiak the first capital of Russian America — a full decade before Sitka assumed that role. The Baranov Museum, housed in the oldest Russian-built structure in the United States, preserves artifacts from this period. These layers — Indigenous, Russian, military, fishing — coexist in a town that feels lived-in and authentic in a way that many Alaskan communities aspire to but few achieve.

## What Makes Kodiak Special

Kodiak's remoteness is its defining characteristic. Unlike Juneau, Ketchikan, or Seward, Kodiak is not on the cruise ship circuit. There are no massive dock facilities, no jewelry stores lining the main street, no buses waiting to shuttle thousands of day-trippers to a scenic overlook. What you find instead is a real Alaskan island community where people fish for a living, the grocery store stocks Alutiiq art alongside canned goods, and the landscape beyond the small road system is genuinely wild. The Kodiak road network covers only about 100 miles — beyond that, every bay, valley, and mountainside is accessible only by boat or bush plane. This is not curated wilderness; it is the real thing.

## Things to Do

**Bear Viewing by Floatplane** — The premier Kodiak experience. Bush plane operators fly you to remote salmon streams and coastal meadows on the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, where guides lead you on foot to within safe viewing distance of feeding bears. Full-day trips run $700-$950 per person, including flight, guide, and lunch. Peak viewing is July through September when salmon are running. Operators like Kodiak Brown Bear Center and Andrew Airways have decades of experience.

**Sport Fishing** — Kodiak offers outstanding salmon fishing (all five Pacific species), halibut, rockfish, and lingcod. Salmon charters run $300-$450 per person for a full day. Halibut fishing trips cost $325-$475. The Buskin River, accessible by road, is a popular spot for bank fishing with a $20 sport fishing license. Road-accessible rivers also produce excellent silver salmon fishing in August and September.

**Fort Abercrombie State Historical Park** — This WWII coastal defense installation sits on dramatic seaside bluffs 4 miles from town. Explore bunkers, gun emplacements, and the military history museum while enjoying some of the best easily accessible coastal scenery on the island. Trails wind through old-growth spruce forest to tide pools and cliff-edge overlooks. Free.

**Baranov Museum** — Housed in a Russian-era fur warehouse built around 1808, this museum chronicles Kodiak's Alutiiq, Russian, and American history through artifacts, photographs, and exhibits. Admission $7 adults. The gift shop carries excellent Alutiiq and Russian crafts.

**Alutiiq Museum & Archaeological Repository** — This community-driven museum tells the story of the Alutiiq people through 7,500 years of history on the archipelago. Exhibits include masks, tools, clothing, and a remarkable collection of archaeological materials. Admission $7 adults. Guided heritage walks and cultural demonstrations are offered in summer.

**Hiking the Island** — Kodiak's road-accessible trails offer remarkable diversity. The Barometer Mountain Trail (a steep 2.5-mile climb to 2,452 feet) delivers sweeping views of the island. The Termination Point Trail is an easy 5-mile coastal walk. Pillar Mountain, right behind town, provides a quick hike with panoramic harbor views. All free.

## Where to Stay

**Budget** — Fort Abercrombie State Park has campsites for $15-$20 per night in a beautiful spruce forest near the ocean. Buskin River State Recreation Site offers camping for $15 near the airport. In town, the Shelikof Lodge has basic rooms starting at $100-$140.

**Mid-Range** — The Best Western Kodiak Inn, the island's largest hotel, offers comfortable rooms for $200-$320 per night with harbor views. The Channel View B&B provides a more intimate experience at $180-$260 per night with home-cooked breakfasts and local knowledge from the owners.

**Luxury** — Remote fishing and bear-viewing lodges are where Kodiak's luxury offerings shine. Kodiak Resort at Larsen Bay offers all-inclusive fishing packages starting at $500-$700 per person per night. The Afognak Wilderness Lodge, located on nearby Afognak Island, provides an exclusive wilderness experience for $700-$900 per person per night including meals, guides, and activities.

## Where to Eat

**Henry's Great Alaskan Restaurant** — The most established restaurant in Kodiak, serving steak, seafood, and pasta in a comfortable setting. The king crab legs (when available) and prime rib are local favorites. Entrees $18-$45.

**Java Flats** — A popular breakfast and lunch cafe with excellent espresso, pastries, and sandwiches. The breakfast burritos are massive. A great spot to fuel up before a day of exploration. Meals $8-$16.

**The Old Powerhouse Restaurant** — Set in a converted power station on the harbor, this seasonal restaurant features Alaska seafood with creative preparations. The halibut cheeks and seafood chowder are standouts. Entrees $20-$40.

**Kodiak Crab Shack** — A no-frills waterfront spot serving fresh crab, fish and chips, and chowder. Exactly what you want after watching boats unload their catch at the harbor. Meals $14-$30.

**El Chicano** — A longtime local Mexican restaurant that also serves American fare. Generous portions, friendly service, and some of the best fish tacos on the island. Meals $12-$24.

## Scott's Pro Tips

**Getting There:** Alaska Airlines flies from Anchorage to Kodiak daily (about 1 hour), with fares typically running $200-$400 round trip. The Alaska Marine Highway ferry from Homer takes about 10 hours and offers a spectacular ocean crossing, but sailings are limited to a few per month — check the schedule carefully and book vehicle space far in advance. There is no road to Kodiak; all access is by air or sea.

**Best Time to Visit:** Late June through August is ideal for weather, bear viewing, and fishing. July offers peak salmon runs and the best bear activity. May and early June can be cool and wet but offer uncrowded fishing and early wildflower blooms. September brings silver salmon, fall colors on the hillsides, and fewer visitors. Kodiak's maritime climate means you can expect rain at any time of year — truly sunny days are gifts, not guarantees.

**Getting Around:** A rental car is essential for exploring beyond downtown Kodiak. The road system extends about 40 miles in each direction from town, reaching Fort Abercrombie, Anton Larsen Bay, Pasagshak Bay, and Fossil Beach. Road conditions are generally good, though some routes are gravel. For anything beyond the road system — including the best bear viewing and fishing — you will need a bush plane or boat charter. Taxis are available in town.

**Budget Tips:** Hike Barometer Mountain and Fort Abercrombie for free — both are outstanding and accessible. Bank fishing on the Buskin River costs only a fishing license ($20 for a day permit for non-residents). The museums are inexpensive ($7 each) and worth the visit. Buy fresh fish directly from the harbor or at local fish markets for a fraction of restaurant prices. If camping, Fort Abercrombie's sites are beautiful and cheap.

**Safety:** Bear awareness is critical everywhere on Kodiak — even on the road system. Carry bear spray on all hikes and know how to use it. Make noise on trails, especially near salmon streams. Kodiak's weather can change rapidly, with fog, wind, and rain rolling in without warning. If you are on a floatplane trip, be prepared for potential weather delays — bush pilots will not fly in unsafe conditions, and you should budget flexibility into your schedule. Ocean conditions around the island can be rough; take seasickness precautions if boat-based activities are planned.

**Packing:** Rain gear is your most important gear on Kodiak — bring a quality waterproof jacket and pants. Rubber boots (Xtratufs) are the standard Kodiak footwear and are perfect for beaches, trails, and wet conditions. Bring warm layers even in summer — fog and wind can make 55°F feel much colder. Binoculars are valuable for bear, eagle, and whale spotting. If you are heading into the backcountry, bring a GPS device and detailed maps, as trails outside the road system are minimal and navigation can be challenging in fog.
