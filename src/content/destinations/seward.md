# Seward: The Soul of Resurrection Bay

Seward sits at the head of Resurrection Bay like a gem in a setting of blue water and dark mountains. This small port town on the Kenai Peninsula has been Alaska's gateway to the sea since 1903, when surveyors chose it as the ocean terminus of the Alaska Railroad. Named after William H. Seward, the Secretary of State who orchestrated the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867, the town has a history that mirrors the broader story of the state itself: Indigenous heritage, Russian influence, American ambition, natural disaster, and resilient reinvention. The 1964 Good Friday earthquake devastated Seward's waterfront, but the town rebuilt with characteristic Alaskan stubbornness, and today it thrives as one of the most visited and most beloved communities in Southcentral Alaska.

The drive from Anchorage to Seward is itself a reason to visit. The 127-mile Seward Highway, designated an All-American Road, threads through the Chugach Mountains along the shore of Turnagain Arm before crossing the Kenai Peninsula through Moose Pass. It is routinely ranked among the most scenic drives in the country. But when you round the final bend and Resurrection Bay opens before you — that impossible blue, the snow-streaked peaks, the glaciers glinting in the distance — you understand that the drive was merely the prologue.

Seward's primary draw is its position as the launching point for Kenai Fjords National Park, where tidewater glaciers calve icebergs directly into the sea and humpback whales breach in waters teeming with puffins, sea otters, and Steller sea lions. But the town itself deserves more than a passing glance. The small boat harbor buzzes with fishing charters and kayak outfitters. The Alaska SeaLife Center, the state's only public aquarium and ocean wildlife rescue facility, sits right on the waterfront. And every July 4th, runners from around the world gather for the Mount Marathon Race, a grueling 3.1-mile sprint straight up the 3,022-foot peak and back — a tradition dating to 1915 and considered one of the toughest footraces in America.

There is something about Seward's scale that feels exactly right. It is large enough to have good restaurants, solid accommodations, and genuine services, yet small enough that you can walk from one end to the other in twenty minutes. The mountains rise directly behind town. The bay opens in front. You are never more than a few steps from either wilderness or civilization, and the balance between the two gives Seward a quality of life — and a quality of visit — that few Alaskan towns can match.

## What Makes Seward Special

Seward's location is its superpower. It sits at the precise intersection of road, rail, and ocean, making it accessible by car, train, or boat while simultaneously serving as the threshold to genuine wilderness. Kenai Fjords National Park begins just miles from downtown, yet you can drive here from Anchorage in under three hours. This combination of accessibility and wildness is rare in Alaska, where getting to remarkable places often requires expensive bush flights or multi-day ferry trips. Seward delivers world-class glaciers, marine wildlife, and mountain scenery with a fraction of the logistical complexity.

## Things to Do

**Kenai Fjords National Park Boat Tour** — The quintessential Seward experience. Full-day cruises (6-8 hours) to Northwestern Fjord or Aialik Bay visit tidewater glaciers and pass through waters rich with humpback whales, orcas, sea otters, puffins, and Steller sea lions. Major Chiswell Islands seabird rookeries are included. Full-day tours run $200-$260 per adult with operators like Major Marine Tours and Kenai Fjords Tours. Half-day options (3-4 hours) focusing on Resurrection Bay cost $100-$150.

**Exit Glacier** — The only part of Kenai Fjords accessible by road, Exit Glacier is a 13-mile drive from Seward (road open roughly May-October). Walk the paved trail to the glacier face (1 mile round trip, free), or hike the strenuous Harding Icefield Trail (8.2 miles round trip, 3,500 feet gain) for views of the vast icefield that feeds more than 40 glaciers. Park entrance fee is $20 per vehicle.

**Alaska SeaLife Center** — This excellent marine research facility and aquarium features Steller sea lions, harbor seals, puffins, octopus, and rehabilitating wildlife. Behind-the-scenes encounters with marine mammals can be booked. Admission is $27 adults, $14 children. Allow 2-3 hours.

**Fishing Charters** — Seward offers outstanding silver salmon fishing (July-September) and halibut fishing (May-September). Half-day halibut charters run $275-$350 per person; full-day combos targeting halibut and salmon are $350-$450. Rockfish and lingcod are also available. The Seward Silver Salmon Derby in August offers cash prizes.

**Resurrection Bay Kayaking** — Guided kayak tours explore the calm waters of Resurrection Bay, paddling past sea otters, harbor seals, and salmon-crowded shorelines. Half-day tours run $90-$150 per person; full-day paddles to Bear Glacier or Caines Head cost $200-$350. Multi-day kayak camping trips are available for the adventurous.

**Caines Head State Recreation Area** — Hike the coastal trail from Lowell Point (accessible only at low tide for the first 2 miles) to reach the WWII-era Fort McGilvray military installation, perched on cliffs above the bay. A 9-mile round trip, this is one of Alaska's most unique day hikes. Free.

## Where to Stay

**Budget** — The Moby Dick Hostel offers dorm beds for $45-$55 and private rooms for $100-$130. Waterfront Park Campground, operated by the city, has tent and RV sites for $20-$50 per night right on the bay. The Exit Glacier area has a basic NPS campground with walk-in sites for $15.

**Mid-Range** — The Hotel Seward and Harbor 360 Hotel offer waterfront rooms in the $200-$320 range during peak summer. The Breeze Inn near the harbor is a reliable mid-range option at $180-$260. Vacation rental cabins on Resurrection Bay start around $200-$350 per night.

**Luxury** — The Seward Windsong Lodge, nestled in a forest setting along the Resurrection River, offers premium rooms and suites for $350-$550 per night. For a true wilderness luxury experience, the Kenai Fjords Glacier Lodge — the only lodge inside Kenai Fjords National Park — runs $600-$900 per night all-inclusive with guided excursions.

## Where to Eat

**The Cookery** — Seward's finest dining experience, featuring creative Alaska seafood preparations with local and seasonal ingredients. The halibut and Kachemak Bay oysters are exceptional. Entrees $24-$42. Reservations strongly recommended.

**Zudy's Cafe** — A beloved breakfast and lunch spot with homemade pastries, excellent espresso, and hearty sandwiches. The cinnamon rolls are legendary. Meals $10-$18.

**Chinooks Waterfront Restaurant** — Overlooking the small boat harbor, Chinooks serves fresh seafood with water views. The salmon chowder is a must-try. Entrees $18-$38.

**Resurrect Art Coffee House** — A quirky cafe housed in a former church, serving espresso, baked goods, and light meals amid local art. A Seward institution. Drinks and snacks $5-$14.

**Apollo Restaurant** — A family-run spot serving surprisingly good Mediterranean and American food. The gyros and fresh halibut burger are local favorites. Entrees $14-$28.

## Scott's Pro Tips

**Getting There:** The Seward Highway from Anchorage is one of the most beautiful drives in North America — do not rush it. Allow at least 3 hours with stops for wildlife (watch for Dall sheep at mile 107 and beluga whales in Turnagain Arm). The Alaska Railroad's Coastal Classic train ($125-$240 one way) runs the same route with even better views and a glass-dome car. Cruise ships and Alaska Marine Highway ferries also serve Seward's port.

**Best Time to Visit:** Late June through August is peak season with the warmest weather and all services operating. July offers the longest days and the famous Mount Marathon Race. August brings peak silver salmon fishing and the Silver Salmon Derby. May and September are quieter with lower prices, but some boat tours may run reduced schedules. Exit Glacier Road typically opens in late May and closes in October.

**Getting Around:** Seward's town center is compact and walkable. A free shuttle runs between the cruise ship terminal, downtown, and the Alaska SeaLife Center during the summer. To reach Exit Glacier, you will need a car or a shuttle ($15-$25 round trip). Rental cars should be reserved in advance for summer. The Alaska Railroad can be used one-way, with a rental car return for the other direction.

**Budget Tips:** The free trails at Exit Glacier and Caines Head deliver world-class scenery without spending a dime. Pack a picnic lunch from the IGA grocery store instead of eating at waterfront restaurants. If the full-day Kenai Fjords boat tour is too expensive, the half-day Resurrection Bay cruise is significantly cheaper and still includes excellent wildlife viewing. Camp at Waterfront Park to save on lodging while enjoying a prime bayfront location.

**Safety:** Hypothermia is a real risk on boat tours even in summer — Resurrection Bay water temperatures hover around 40°F. Wear layers and bring a warm hat and gloves for any time on the water. If hiking the Harding Icefield Trail, be prepared for rapidly changing weather, snow on the upper trail even in August, and high winds. Bear awareness is important on all trails — carry bear spray and make noise.

**Packing:** Dress in layers with a waterproof outer shell. Boat tours can be cold and wet even on sunny days, so bring warm, moisture-wicking base layers, a fleece, and waterproof pants. Binoculars are essential for wildlife viewing on boat tours. Sunscreen and sunglasses are necessary on clear days, as UV reflection off water and ice is intense. Bring sturdy hiking footwear if you plan to hike Harding Icefield or Caines Head — these are real mountain trails, not boardwalks.
