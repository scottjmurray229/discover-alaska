# Ketchikan: Alaska's First City

Perched on the southwestern edge of Revillagigedo Island, Ketchikan clings to the mountainside like a barnacle on a dock piling. This is Alaska's "First City" — the first major community northbound travelers encounter when entering the state by sea — and it wastes no time making an impression. Stilt houses hover above Ketchikan Creek, bald eagles wheel overhead, and the air carries the unmistakable brine-and-cedar scent of the Pacific Northwest rainforest. With over 140 inches of rain per year, Ketchikan is one of the wettest places in North America, but locals wear that distinction like a badge of honor. The rain feeds the salmon streams, nourishes the towering Sitka spruce, and keeps this town impossibly, almost supernaturally green.

Long before Russian or American settlers arrived, this stretch of coastline belonged to the Tlingit people, whose art and traditions remain deeply woven into the fabric of the community. Ketchikan holds the world's largest collection of standing totem poles — more than 80 scattered across parks, heritage centers, and village sites. These aren't museum replicas behind glass; they stand in the open air, telling stories of clans, ancestors, and the natural world in a visual language that has endured for millennia. Visiting the Totem Heritage Center or Saxman Native Village is not merely a cultural excursion — it is a chance to witness a living tradition, as master carvers continue to create new poles using centuries-old techniques.

Then there is the fishing. Ketchikan's self-proclaimed title as the "Salmon Capital of the World" is no idle boast. Five species of Pacific salmon — king, sockeye, pink, chum, and silver — run through these waters at different points from May through September. The town's economy was built on commercial fishing and canneries, and while tourism has grown into a dominant industry, the fishing identity remains absolute. Charter boats line the harbor every morning, and during peak pink salmon runs in July and August, you can literally watch thousands of fish surging upstream beneath the viewing platform at Ketchikan Creek, right in the middle of downtown.

Ketchikan is also the gateway to Misty Fjords National Monument, a 2.3-million-acre wilderness of sheer granite cliffs, plunging waterfalls, and mirror-still fjords that rank among the most dramatic landscapes in all of Alaska. Whether you arrive by floatplane or boat, the first glimpse of New Eddystone Rock rising from the ocean like a volcanic sentinel is a moment you will carry with you long after you leave.

## What Makes Ketchikan Special

Ketchikan occupies a unique position in Alaska's southeast panhandle. It is simultaneously a major cruise port — welcoming nearly a million visitors each summer — and a fiercely independent small town with deep Tlingit, Filipino, and Scandinavian roots. The result is a place with genuine cultural complexity that rewards curious visitors willing to look beyond the tourist shops on Mission Street. Creek Street, a former red-light district built on boardwalks above the creek, has been reinvented as a quirky strip of galleries, shops, and cafes, but its history remains delightfully unvarnished. The town's compactness is another asset: nearly everything worth seeing is within walking distance of the cruise ship docks, yet the surrounding wilderness is vast and immediate.

## Things to Do

**Totem Heritage Center & Totem Parks** — Visit the Totem Heritage Center ($6 admission) to see original 19th-century poles recovered from abandoned Tlingit and Haida villages. Then walk through Totem Bight State Historical Park (free) and Saxman Native Village ($5-$40 depending on tour) to see poles in outdoor settings. Guided cultural tours with Tlingit interpreters run $40-$65 per person and are worth every cent.

**Misty Fjords Flightseeing** — A floatplane tour of Misty Fjords National Monument is the single best excursion in Ketchikan. Flights last 1.5-2 hours, include a water landing on a remote lake, and cost $280-$350 per person. Book with local operators like Island Wings or Southeast Aviation.

**Salmon Fishing Charters** — Half-day charters (4-5 hours) run $250-$350 per person; full-day trips are $400-$550. King salmon season peaks in June, silvers run strong in August and September, and pink salmon flood the creeks in July-August. Most charters include gear, bait, and fish processing.

**Creek Street Walking Tour** — Stroll the boardwalk above Ketchikan Creek for free. Visit Dolly's House Museum ($10), a preserved brothel-turned-museum from the town's rowdy past. In July and August, the salmon-viewing platform here offers some of the best urban fish watching in Alaska.

**Rainforest Canopy Zipline** — Several operators run zipline courses through old-growth Tongass National Forest. Expect to pay $170-$220 per person for a 2-3 hour experience that includes suspension bridges and platforms high in the canopy.

**Tongass National Forest Hiking** — The Rainbird Trail and Deer Mountain Trail are both accessible from downtown. Deer Mountain is a strenuous 5-mile round trip with 3,000 feet of elevation gain, rewarding hikers with panoramic views on clear days. No fees required.

## Where to Stay

**Budget** — The Rain Forest Inn offers clean rooms starting around $90-$120 per night. For the true budget traveler, the Eagle's Roost Campground operated by the Forest Service provides tent sites for $10-$15 per night just north of town.

**Mid-Range** — The Landing Hotel sits right on the waterfront with harbor views and rooms in the $180-$280 range during summer. The Cape Fox Lodge, perched on a hillside overlooking the town (accessible by funicular), offers uniquely Alaskan atmosphere for $200-$300 per night.

**Luxury** — The Narrows Inn on the waterfront runs $280-$450 per night with spacious suites and water views. For a true splurge, book a private lodge at a remote fishing resort like Salmon Falls Resort, where all-inclusive packages start around $600 per person per night.

## Where to Eat

**Annabelle's Famous Keg and Chowder House** — Located inside the historic Gilmore Hotel, Annabelle's serves award-winning clam chowder and fresh halibut fish and chips. Entrees $18-$35. A local institution since the 1980s.

**Bar Harbor Restaurant** — Overlooking the cruise ship docks, Bar Harbor offers some of the best waterfront seafood dining in town. The pan-seared salmon and Dungeness crab legs are standouts. Entrees $22-$45.

**Burger Queen** — A beloved local counter-service spot near the tunnel with massive burgers, hand-cut fries, and milkshakes. Cash-friendly meals $12-$18.

**Alaska Fish House** — Situated right on the water near Salmon Landing, this casual spot serves fish tacos, chowder, and grilled salmon plates. Perfect for a quick lunch. Meals $14-$26.

**Diaz Cafe** — A hidden gem serving Filipino and American comfort food, reflecting Ketchikan's significant Filipino community. Hearty, affordable plates $10-$18.

## Scott's Pro Tips

**Getting There:** Ketchikan has no road connection to the rest of Alaska. You arrive by air (Alaska Airlines flies from Seattle and Juneau daily) or by sea (Alaska Marine Highway ferries, cruise ships, or Inter-Island Ferry Authority from Hollis on Prince of Wales Island). If arriving by ferry, book vehicle space months in advance for summer travel.

**Best Time to Visit:** June through August offers the warmest weather and peak salmon runs, but also the highest cruise ship traffic. May and September are shoulder months with fewer crowds, lower prices, and still-decent weather. September brings silver salmon and fall colors. Expect rain anytime — this is a temperate rainforest.

**Getting Around:** Downtown Ketchikan is very walkable — about a mile from end to end along the waterfront. The local bus system runs limited routes for $2 per ride. Rental cars are available but unnecessary unless you plan to explore the road system to Saxman (2 miles south) or North Tongass Highway. Taxis and rideshares are limited.

**Budget Tips:** Many of Ketchikan's best experiences are free: walking Creek Street, visiting Totem Bight State Park, hiking Deer Mountain, and watching salmon spawn in the creek. Pack rain gear and a reusable water bottle to avoid overpriced tourist-shop purchases. If you arrive by cruise ship, skip the ship-organized excursions and book directly with local operators for 20-40% savings.

**Safety:** Ketchikan is a very safe town, but the terrain demands respect. Boardwalks can be slippery when wet (which is almost always). If hiking Deer Mountain, bring layers, rain gear, and bear spray — black bears are common in the surrounding forest. Water conditions in Misty Fjords can change rapidly; trust your floatplane or boat pilot's judgment on weather calls.

**Packing:** A waterproof rain jacket is non-negotiable — not a suggestion, a requirement. Bring waterproof hiking boots or shoes, layers for temperatures in the 50s-60s, and a compact umbrella. Binoculars are excellent for eagle and whale spotting along the waterfront. If fishing, most charters provide gear but bring your own polarized sunglasses and seasickness remedy.
