const faqItems = [
  { question: 'When is the best time to see the Northern Lights in Alaska?', answer: 'September through March, with peak viewing around the equinoxes (late September/early October and late March). You need dark skies, so the midnight sun of summer rules out June and July entirely. August is marginal. September offers the best combination of dark nights, mild temperatures, and open roads and lodges. Deep winter (December-February) offers the most hours of darkness but the coldest temperatures (-20 to -40 F in Fairbanks).' },
  { question: 'Is Fairbanks or Anchorage better for Northern Lights?', answer: 'Fairbanks, by a wide margin. Fairbanks sits directly under the auroral oval at 64.8 degrees north latitude and averages 200+ aurora-viewable nights per year. Anchorage is 360 miles further south (61.2 N) and sees the aurora far less frequently — only on nights with strong geomagnetic activity (Kp 4+). If seeing the Northern Lights is a priority, fly to Fairbanks. Anchorage is a bonus, not a destination for aurora.' },
  { question: 'What camera settings do I need for aurora photos?', answer: 'Manual mode, wide-angle lens (14-24mm ideal), f/2.8 or wider, ISO 1600-6400, shutter speed 5-15 seconds depending on aurora movement. Use a sturdy tripod and a remote shutter release or 2-second timer. Turn off image stabilization on a tripod. Focus manually on a bright star or distant light and tape the focus ring. Shoot RAW for maximum editing flexibility. Bring spare batteries — cold drains them fast.' },
  { question: 'How cold does it get during aurora season in Alaska?', answer: 'It varies dramatically by month and location. September in Fairbanks averages 30-50 F — quite comfortable with layers. By December through February, Fairbanks regularly drops to -20 to -40 F. Anchorage is milder (10-30 F in winter). Dress in layers: moisture-wicking base, insulating mid-layer, windproof outer shell. Insulated boots (rated to -40 F), heavy mittens, and a balaclava are essential for extended winter viewing.' },
  { question: 'How do I check the aurora forecast?', answer: 'The UAF Geophysical Institute aurora forecast (gi.alaska.edu/monitors/aurora-forecast) is the gold standard — it predicts aurora activity on a scale of 0-9 for Fairbanks, updated frequently. The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (swpc.noaa.gov) provides global forecasts. The My Aurora Forecast app is excellent for mobile alerts. A Kp index of 3+ usually means visible aurora in Fairbanks; Kp 5+ for Anchorage.' },
  { question: 'Can I see the Northern Lights from Juneau or Southeast Alaska?', answer: 'Rarely. Southeast Alaska is at a lower latitude (Juneau is 58.3 N) and has persistent cloud cover from maritime weather. The aurora is occasionally visible during very strong geomagnetic storms (Kp 6+), but you cannot plan a trip to Southeast Alaska expecting to see the Northern Lights. If aurora viewing is your goal, go to Fairbanks. Southeast is for glaciers, whales, and rainforest.' },
  { question: 'Do I need to book an aurora tour or can I see them on my own?', answer: 'You can absolutely see them on your own if you have a car and are willing to drive to dark-sky locations outside of town. Guided tours ($100-200/person) are worth it for first-timers because guides know the best spots, monitor conditions in real-time, provide warm gear, and help with camera settings. If you are staying at Chena Hot Springs or Coldfoot Camp, you do not need a separate tour — just walk outside.' },

        <p>The first time I saw the Northern Lights in Alaska, I stood outside in Fairbanks at 2 AM in September and watched a faint green arc slowly brighten, then suddenly explode into curtains of green and purple light rippling across the entire sky. It lasted forty minutes and I forgot I was cold. The aurora is not something you just see — it moves, it pulses, it changes color, and it makes you feel very small and very lucky to be standing under it.</p>
