  { question: 'What is the most iconic Alaska food?', answer: 'Wild-caught salmon is Alaska\'s defining food — five species, available fresh from May through September, and prepared every way imaginable. King crab legs are the luxury icon. Beyond seafood, reindeer sausage from an Anchorage street cart is the most distinctly Alaska food experience. Sourdough bread and birch syrup connect to Gold Rush history. Alaska does not have one dish — it has an entire seafood and wild food culture.' },
  { question: 'When is the best time for fresh seafood in Alaska?', answer: 'Copper River salmon arrives mid-May and is the first premium run of the year. King salmon peaks in June and July. Sockeye runs through July and August. Halibut season runs March through November (best June-September). King crab is available year-round but is primarily harvested October through January. Dungeness crab is best in summer. For the widest variety of fresh seafood, visit June through August.' },
  { question: 'How much should I budget for food in Alaska?', answer: 'Alaska food is more expensive than the lower 48. Budget meals: $12-20 (fish and chips, reindeer sausage, diner breakfast). Mid-range restaurants: $25-50 per person. King crab dinner: $60-120 per person. Grocery prices are 30-50% higher than the national average, especially in remote areas. A realistic daily food budget is $50-80 per person eating at local restaurants, or $100-150 if you want king crab and fine dining.' },
  { question: 'Can I buy fresh fish to take home from Alaska?', answer: 'Yes. Most fish processors in Seward, Homer, Juneau, and Ketchikan will flash-freeze and pack your fish for airline transport in insulated boxes. If you go sport fishing (halibut charters from $250-350/person), your catch can be processed and shipped home. Without fishing, buy flash-frozen vacuum-sealed salmon and halibut from fish markets — it travels well in checked luggage with cold packs. 10th & M Seafoods in Anchorage is excellent for retail purchases.' },
  { question: 'Is Alaska food just seafood?', answer: 'Seafood dominates, but Alaska\'s food scene is broader than you might expect. Reindeer sausage, bison, and game meats offer alternatives. The sourdough tradition is deeply rooted. Wild berries (blueberry, salmonberry, lingonberry) appear in desserts statewide. Birch syrup is uniquely Alaskan. Anchorage has growing Thai, Korean, and Mexican food scenes. The craft beer and coffee cultures are excellent. And every town has a great breakfast spot.' },
  { question: 'What should I bring home from Alaska?', answer: 'Smoked salmon (vacuum-sealed, TSA-friendly) is the number one souvenir food. Birch syrup from Kahiltna Birchworks. Wild berry jams and sauces from Alaska Wild Berry Products. Alaskan Brewing beer (available in cans for easy packing). Reindeer sausage (vacuum-sealed). Kelp seasonings from Alaska Pure Sea Salt. Avoid buying fish that is not properly frozen and packed — it will not survive the flight home without processing.' },
  { question: 'Are there good vegetarian options in Alaska?', answer: 'Anchorage has the best vegetarian options — Snow City Cafe, Moose\'s Tooth, and several Thai and Indian restaurants. Outside Anchorage, vegetarian options thin out quickly. Seafood dominates menus in coastal towns. Fairbanks has some options at the university area restaurants. If you are strict vegetarian, you will eat well in Anchorage and need to be flexible elsewhere. Many restaurants can modify dishes — just ask.' },

        <p>Alaska's food scene is defined by one thing: freshness. When a restaurant says the halibut was caught that morning, they mean it — the boat is tied up at the dock out back. I have had king crab legs so fresh they were still warm from the steamer at Tracy's in Juneau, sourdough pancakes with birch syrup in Fairbanks, and reindeer sausage from a street cart in Anchorage at midnight under a pink Alaska sky. The seafood is world-class, but the wild foods — berries, game, birch syrup — are what make Alaska cuisine genuinely unique.</p>
