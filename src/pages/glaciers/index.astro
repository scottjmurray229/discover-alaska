  { question: 'When is the best time to visit Alaska\'s glaciers?', answer: 'June through September offers the best conditions. Boat tours, flightseeing, and hiking trails are all operational during summer months. July and August are peak season with the warmest weather and longest days. Late May and early September are shoulder season with lower prices and fewer crowds, though some tours may not yet be running or may have ended. Calving activity tends to be most dramatic in mid to late summer as temperatures rise.' },
  { question: 'Are Alaska\'s glaciers safe to visit?', answer: 'Viewing glaciers from boats, visitor centers, and maintained trails is very safe. Walking on glacial ice requires proper equipment (crampons, ice axes) and ideally a guide — crevasses, ice caves, and unstable ice are real hazards. Never approach a glacier face on foot; calving ice can create massive waves. On boat tours, captains maintain safe distances. Helicopter tours operated by licensed companies have strong safety records.' },
  { question: 'What is a tidewater glacier?', answer: 'A tidewater glacier flows from land into the ocean, where its face (terminus) stands in seawater. When chunks of ice break off the face and crash into the water, that is called calving. Alaska has more tidewater glaciers than anywhere else in the Americas. Glacier Bay alone has seven active tidewater glaciers. The calving process creates the icebergs, bergy bits, and growlers you see floating in the fjords.' },
  { question: 'How much do glacier tours cost in Alaska?', answer: 'Costs vary widely by experience. Roadside glacier viewing (Exit Glacier, Worthington, Matanuska access) runs $0–30. Half-day boat tours are $150–220 per person. Full-day boat tours are $200–300. Helicopter tours with glacier landing are $300–500. Kayaking near glaciers is $75–200. Flightseeing with glacier landing from Talkeetna is $275–500. The cheapest glacier experiences are self-guided hikes at Exit Glacier and Worthington Glacier.' },
  { question: 'Can I walk on a glacier in Alaska?', answer: 'Yes, but with proper equipment and ideally a guide. Matanuska Glacier is the most accessible for ice hiking — guided tours provide crampons and instruction. Helicopter tours land on glaciers near Juneau and in the Alaska Range for guided walks. Exit Glacier\'s Harding Icefield Trail reaches the edge of the ice field but does not cross it. Never walk on glacial ice alone without proper training and gear.' },
  { question: 'Which glacier is best for seeing calving?', answer: 'Margerie Glacier in Glacier Bay is the most reliably active for calving — the day boat spends about an hour at the face and you will almost certainly see and hear major calving events. Aialik and Holgate Glaciers in Kenai Fjords are also very active. Columbia Glacier near Valdez calves enormous icebergs. Mendenhall Glacier calves into its lake, though less frequently than the tidewater glaciers.' },
  { question: 'Are Alaska glaciers retreating?', answer: 'Most Alaska glaciers are retreating due to climate change. Exit Glacier\'s trail markers show dramatic retreat over the past century. Mendenhall Glacier has retreated significantly since the 1950s. Columbia Glacier has lost over half its length since the 1980s. A few glaciers, like Meares and Hubbard, are advancing. Visiting glaciers today provides both a spectacular experience and a sobering look at the pace of environmental change.' },

        <p>Nothing in Alaska stops you in your tracks quite like standing in front of a tidewater glacier. The scale is disorienting — a mile-wide wall of blue ice rising 200 feet out of the water, groaning and cracking, and then a piece the size of a building drops into the ocean with a sound like thunder. I have seen glaciers by boat in Kenai Fjords, by helicopter in Juneau, and on foot at Matanuska, and each experience is completely different.
