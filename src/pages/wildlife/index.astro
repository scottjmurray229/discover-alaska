const faqItems = [
  { question: 'How close can I get to bears in Alaska?', answer: 'National Park Service guidelines recommend staying at least 300 yards (900 feet) from bears. At designated viewing areas like Brooks Falls (Katmai) and Pack Creek, platforms allow closer viewing under controlled conditions. Never approach a bear on your own. If a bear approaches you, stand your ground, speak calmly, and slowly back away. Carry bear spray in bear country and know how to use it. Most bear encounters in Alaska are peaceful if you follow the rules.' },
  { question: 'What should I do if I encounter a moose?', answer: 'Give moose at least 50 feet of space — they are more dangerous than bears in Alaska, responsible for more injuries annually. Cow moose with calves and bull moose in rut (September-October) are the most aggressive. If a moose charges, run and get behind a tree or vehicle — unlike bears, running from moose is the right call. They kick with devastating force. In Anchorage, be especially alert on trails and in neighborhoods during spring calving.' },
  { question: 'When is the best time for wildlife viewing in Alaska?', answer: 'Summer (June through September) is the primary wildlife viewing season. Bears at Brooks Falls peak in July and September. Whale watching is best July through August. Eagles at Haines peak in November. Caribou migration happens in late summer (August-September) and spring (March-April). Moose are visible year-round but rut in September. Each species has its own optimal window — plan your trip around the animals you most want to see.' },
  { question: 'Do I need bear spray in Alaska?', answer: 'Yes, carry bear spray whenever you are hiking or camping outside of developed areas. It is the single most effective defense against bear charges — more effective than firearms in most encounters. Buy it in Alaska (it cannot fly in checked luggage on most airlines). Practice drawing and deploying it before you need it. Bear spray is effective to about 20 feet and creates a cloud of capsaicin. It is sold at outdoor stores throughout Alaska for $40–55.' },
  { question: 'Can I see wildlife without an expensive tour?', answer: 'Absolutely. Moose are free and everywhere in Anchorage. The Seward Highway offers free Dall sheep viewing. Bald eagles are common in every coastal town. Denali National Park bus rides ($55–75) are one of the best wildlife viewing values in Alaska. The Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center near Portage ($13) guarantees sightings of bears, moose, bison, and more. The expensive fly-in bear viewing and whale watching tours are amazing but not the only option.' },
  { question: 'What wildlife can I see from a cruise ship?', answer: 'Alaska cruise ships regularly spot humpback whales, orca, sea otters, harbor seals, Steller sea lions, bald eagles, and sometimes bears on shore. Glacier Bay is excellent for whales and sea otters. Ports like Juneau, Ketchikan, and Sitka offer whale watching, bear viewing, and eagle encounters as shore excursions. Bring binoculars and spend time on deck. Early morning and late evening are best for spotting wildlife from the ship.' },
