The major highways (Seward, Parks, Glenn, Richardson, Sterling) are paved and well-maintained. Total paved road mileage in Alaska is less than most Lower 48 states — you cannot drive to Juneau, Kodiak, Nome, or most of Southeast Alaska.

Make noise on trails to avoid surprising bears. Store food in bear-resistant containers when camping. Never run from a bear. If you encounter a brown bear, speak calmly and back away slowly.

In winter, exposed skin can get frostbite in minutes at -20°F and below. Carry emergency supplies (blanket, food, water, headlamp) on every hike, no matter how short.',

This is exhilarating but disorienting — bring a sleep mask and set alarms, because your body clock will lose all reference points. In December, Anchorage sees roughly 5.5 hours of daylight, and Utqiagvik (Barrow) has 67 days of complete polar night. Plan activities and driving accordingly.',

The Parks Highway has spotty service between Anchorage and Fairbanks. Denali backcountry, Wrangell-St. Elias, and most of the Bush have no service at all. Rent or buy a satellite communicator (Garmin inReach, $15-50/month plan) if you are heading into remote areas. It could save your life.',

Turnagain Arm near Anchorage has extreme tidal flats that act like quicksand; people have died after getting stuck and being caught by the incoming bore tide.

A quality waterproof jacket is the single most important item you will pack. Bring waterproof pants too — you will want them on boat tours, glacier hikes, and rainy trail days.

Binoculars are nearly as important: spotting wildlife (moose, bears, eagles, whales, puffins) from a safe distance is a daily occurrence in Alaska. A good 8x42 or 10x42 pair transforms every drive and hike. Compact binoculars work but full-size are noticeably better.',

Bring DEET-based repellent (30%+ concentration) or Picaridin. A head net ($5-10) is invaluable for serious hiking in backcountry. Permethrin-treated clothing adds another layer of protection. The mosquitoes are worst in late June and early July.',

const faqItems = [
  { question: 'Do I need a car in Alaska?', answer: 'For road-accessible destinations like Denali, the Kenai Peninsula, and the drive between Anchorage and Fairbanks, yes — a rental car gives you the most flexibility. Exceptions: Juneau, Skagway, and other Southeast Alaska towns are best explored on foot or with tours (you cannot drive to them anyway). Anchorage has limited public transit. The Alaska Railroad connects Anchorage, Denali, and Fairbanks if you prefer not to drive. For remote areas like Katmai, Kodiak, or Nome, you will need a bush plane.' },
  { question: 'Is Alaska safe for tourists?', answer: 'Alaska is generally safe for tourists, but wilderness risks are real and must be respected. The biggest dangers are hypothermia from sudden weather changes, bear encounters on trails, drowning in cold rivers, and getting stranded in remote areas without cell service. Always carry bear spray when hiking, tell someone your plans, and carry a satellite communicator in the backcountry. In towns, standard precautions apply. Wildlife encounters are common but manageable with proper behavior.' },
  { question: 'How much should I budget for an Alaska vacation?', answer: 'Budget travelers: $100-150/day (camping, cooking, free hikes). Mid-range: $200-350/day (hotels, restaurants, one paid tour every other day). Luxury: $500-1,500+/day (wilderness lodges, helicopter tours, private fishing). A typical 10-day mid-range Alaska trip for two costs $5,000-8,000 including flights, car rental, accommodation, food, and 3-4 excursions. Flights from the Lower 48 typically run $300-600 round-trip to Anchorage.' },
  { question: 'What is the cheapest time to visit Alaska?', answer: 'May and September offer the best combination of lower prices and decent weather. Hotel rates drop 20-40% from peak summer. Winter (October-April) has the absolute lowest prices — Anchorage hotel rates can drop below $100/night — but most remote lodges, tours, and some roads are closed. Shoulder seasons give you most of the Alaska experience at significantly reduced cost.' },
  { question: 'Can I see the northern lights in Alaska?', answer: 'Yes — Fairbanks is one of the top aurora destinations in the world, with visible aurora approximately 240 nights per year. The best viewing season is September through March, when skies are dark. You need clear skies and low light pollution. Chena Hot Springs Resort, about 60 miles from Fairbanks, is a popular viewing spot with hot spring soaking under the lights. The aurora is not visible in summer due to 24-hour daylight.' },
  { question: 'How bad are the mosquitoes in Alaska?', answer: 'In Interior Alaska and tundra areas from mid-June through mid-August, mosquitoes are genuinely intense — clouds of them. Coastal areas (Juneau, Seward) are significantly better. Anchorage is moderate. DEET or Picaridin repellent is essential. A head net is invaluable in backcountry. The mosquitoes peak in late June and early July, then taper off by mid-August. After the first hard frost in fall, they disappear entirely.' },
  { question: 'What is the best Alaska road trip route?', answer: 'The classic loop: Fly into Anchorage, drive south to Seward and Kenai Fjords (2.5 hours), explore the Kenai Peninsula, then drive north on the Parks Highway to Denali National Park (4.5 hours from Anchorage), continue to Fairbanks (2.5 hours from Denali), and fly out from Fairbanks. Allow 10-14 days minimum. Add the Glenn Highway to Valdez for glaciers and the Richardson Highway for remote scenery. The Seward Highway from Anchorage is one of the most scenic drives in America.' },
  { question: 'Do I need prior hiking experience for Alaska trails?', answer: 'Many of Alaska\'s best trails are beginner-friendly: Exit Glacier\'s Harding Icefield Trail access point, Flattop Mountain near Anchorage, and the paved Tony Knowles Coastal Trail. But conditions are different from the Lower 48 — trails can be muddy, rooty, poorly marked, and you must always be bear-aware. Carry bear spray, make noise, and hike in groups when possible. Backcountry hiking in Denali or Wrangell-St. Elias requires strong navigation skills and wilderness experience.' },

        <p>The biggest mistake first-time Alaska visitors make is underestimating the scale. Anchorage to Denali is 4.5 hours. Anchorage to Fairbanks is 6 hours. And you cannot drive to most of Southeast Alaska at all — Juneau, Ketchikan, and Sitka are only reachable by plane or ferry. The second mistake is not packing rain gear.
